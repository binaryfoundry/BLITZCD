It was my fault this time, sorry...

You would not believe how much trouble I've had putting this issue 
together (again, after I lost everything!), so I won't explain ;)

I hope you like this BUM as it will probably be the last one ever,
it's certainly the last one for me anyway...


Goodbye and thanks, you've been a lovely audience.




Things to note:

        - Most of the examples have runtime error checking on, so once you
          know the example compiles correctly, take runtime error checking
          off and recompile.

        - A few examples on BUM10Examples2 require a good chunk of free
          memory so 1Mb users don't even think about trying to compile
          them.. 2Mb users will probably struggle as well with some of my
          demos and Nigels ChunkyLandscape.bb2

        - Some of the examples will not compile when running Blitz from
          floppy disk as they use commands from libraries on the Blitzlibs
          disk. (see BUM9 docs on how to create a new deflibs)

        - If you are using Ted v1.1 don't forget to click the CD gadget on
          the Load File Requester as quite a few of the examples need to
          load additional data from the disk. With the new Ted v2.1 you do
          not need to change the directory anymore as it is done
          automatically when you load the example.


Things I said that had to be done for BUM10:

        - Get the Acid 3D library beta version from Simon (arghhh!!!)

          Nope ! but Nigel has given me a nice library that handles lots
          of '3D maths stuff' and has some chunky drawing commands.

        - Write plenty of examples for Acids Chunky/Chock library

          Not exactly, but I have written a complete set of c2p includes
          to compliment the chunkylib and one example ;)

        - Bug fixes to some of the Acidlibs

          Hmmm.. well Steve Matty sent me four fixed Acidlibs, but since
          I lost everything on my HD I can't create a new Acidlibs.. doh
          (in case you wanted to know, the fixed acidlibs are bbaslib.obj,
           bbgtlib.obj, gadgetslib.obj and windowslib.obj)
          
        - Bug fixes to NewTed (probably)

          Yes, now it's version 2.23 and it's SuperTed not NewTed!

        - Add extra documentation to the on-line help  

          Nope, but at least NewTed/SuperTed users can now edit the help
          files themselves as they're in .guide format ;)



People who deserve Thanks:

        - Xbones, ><>, Ralf, etc..          
	
        - RWE/RI
	
        - Everyone who has contributed to this BUM release.

                            ===================
                            BUM10 Disk Contents
                            ===================


Blitz2
------

A direct replacement for the program disk that came with your original
Blitz2.1 package. See ReleaseNotes on the program disk for changes.



Blitzlibs
---------

This contains all the latest third party libraries and the new test
libraries. It also contains the resident files and two small Blitz
programs to allow you to create a new deflibs file and also view the
commands in any library.


includes  - A new include file has been added called asmmacs.bb2. It's
            a small (at the moment ;) collection of macros by Steven
            Matty which add a few more commands to the Blitz assembler

amigalibs - Unchanged from BUM9 

otherlibs - As with BUM9 but, XBciatrackerlib is now version 1.04,
            GKdbaselib and XBaudiolib are now in this directory instead
            of testlibs

rilibs    - Unchanged from BUM9
  
testlibs  - Three new userlibs - XBsoundsystemlib, RWEmathlib, PRemllib


Sorry Hard Disk users, but there was no space to make up a new large
deflibs file for you so use the LibMan utility from BUM9 to create one.
The deflibs file should be around 197K if you include all the libraries
on the Blitzlibs disk.

Don't forget that the Acid chunkylib and cd32lib are on the Blitz2
program disk in the directory Blitz2:Userlibs/Beta/ and should be copied
into the same directory on your Hard Disk.
 


BUM10Examples1
--------------

BUM10Docs - Documents for the new userlibs, my c2p stuff and the two
            Acidlib documents that still haven't been converted to
            'acidhelp' or amigaguide... 
            
UserCode1 - Lots of examples which are mainly applications related.

UserGame  - Two games all with documentation/source code - An OS-friendly
            card game by S.E.Morris (><>) and a shoot-em-up by Manfred
            Linzner (Pink). 



BUM10Examples2
--------------

TedsDemos - My chunky to planar includes, more display examples and a
            hideous processor/blitter line draw routine, oh and an
            application type thing - Ted_cdplayer ;)

UserCode2 - Lots of display/graphics related examples - some nice things
            by Nigel to demonstrate his new library, couple of starfields
            by ><> and some 'demoy' examples by Pink.
