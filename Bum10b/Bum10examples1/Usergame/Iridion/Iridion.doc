This is a small preview of our upcoming Shoot´Em´Up.
The game is using the THX Sound System for playing the music
and sound-effects.There are only a few enemies and no backrounds included.

Use a joystick/gamepad to direct your ship (!)
Use SPACE or the second button from a gamepad (sega/cd32/etc.) for
the extra selection.
