FAST 21
-------



Overview
~~~~~~~~
'Fast 21' is a game of skill and quick reactions written using Blitz 
BASIC 2 from Acid Software.  It is remotely similar to the old game
Tetris, except instead of using coloured blocks you are now playing
with a deck of cards.


Before Running Fast 21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fast 21 is written using the OS.  It runs on an Intuition screen, but
unfortunately due to space limitations on the screen it can only used
on a PAL Amiga and the usual screen title bar is not visible.  You
can still use LAMIGA+M to flip screens, and on OS 3.0 you can drag
the screen up and down using the LAMIGA and the mouse, as usual.

Because Fast 21 multitasks with the rest of the programs running
on your system it is advised that you shut down any processor
hungry or OS intensive programs before attempting to play Fast 21.



Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game is played out on a 5x5 grid.  At the top of the screen is
a deck of cards - of which the next 3 cards are visible.  You must
decide where to position each card in turn. The cards drop into 
position on the grid and the idea is to try and build winning lines 
either horizontally (by row) or vertically (by column).  Once a 
winning line is built it will be removed from the grid - if it's a 
row then any cards above will drop down to fill the gap.

To make it more difficult the game is played against a clock, and 
the player must use all 54 cards in the deck (2 jokers are included
along with the regular cards) before the time runs out.  If you
are successful then the clock will be reset and the game continues
with a new deck.

The game ends if the player runs out of time before finishing a 
deck, or if the grid becomes full up with no possible winning lines
which can be removed (all lines are 'bust'!).

The possible winning lines (and scores) are:

    777              (3 7's)                    1000
    777 Joker        (3 7's using jokers)        750
    5 Card 21        (5 card trick, totals 21)   500
    5 Card           (5 card trick)              300
    21               (Cards total 21)            200

If you get a winning line on a row (horizontally) then it will be
multiplied by the row number.  Bottom row = x1 .... top row = x5.
Thus a 21 on the bottom row will score 200, but on the top row
it will score 200x5 = 1000.  Points will also be awarded when you
finish a deck (1000 points) or if you manage to clear the grid
of all cards (1000 points).

The aces can be treated as high or low (11 or 1) and the game will
automatically adjust the value of any aces to attempt to prevent
a line from going bust.

To help you, there are two extra features in your favour.  The first
is the inclusion in the deck of two jokers which can be used to
substitute for any other card.  The game will automatically figure
out the best substitution for you - but if it cannot create a winning
line straight away it will assume the value of 11 (a high ace) until
such time as it can create a winning line.

The second feature is the swap.  Whenever you get a winning line you
will be awarded a 'swap'.  These can be used at any time to reject the 
next card in the deck - swapping it to the back.  However, there is a
maximum number of swaps you are allowed to collect at any one time.

When a pack is used up, as mentioned above, the timer is reset back
to the start and a new deck is shuffled and introduced.  However - 
two further things will happen:  Firstly the timer will speed up,
giving you less time on the new deck than on the last.  Secondly the
maximum number of 'swaps' you are allowed to keep will be reduced by
one (down to a minimum of three).  If you currently have maximum
swaps when this happens you will not be penalised - but once you start
using them you'll find you cannot build them back up to the same level.



Controls
~~~~~~~~
    ESC                   = Quit the game.
    F1 - F5               = Select column to place card.
    SPACE                 = Swap card to back.
    Left Mouse Button     = Select column to place card.
    Right Mouse Button    = Swap card to back.



Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the title screen there may be an option to switch on/off solid card
mode.  (The source code enables the program to be compiled without this
feature so that the extra memory required by it does not need to be
used.  If this is the case then the option will not appear on the title
screen.)

    Off - When the cards move across the screen into the grid, they
          appear as wireframe.  This is advisable if you are running
          a low-spec Amiga (pre-AGA) and/or no Fast RAM.
    On  - The cards will fly across the screen into the grid as they
          appear in the deck (ie. full solid graphic!)  This will burden
          the system with a heavy work load, so it's advisable not to use
          this with low-spec systems or if you are multitasking a lot of 
          other tasks while playing the game.
