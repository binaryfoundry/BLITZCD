                      =====================
                       BUM10 Release Notes
                      =====================

  -=* Additional documentation is on the BUM10Examples1 disk *=-



----------------------------
New things for this release:
----------------------------

- New Teditor version 2.23 for WB2+ Amigas only (and it really
  needs a Hard Drive for the acid help guides)         
 
- Steve Flock CIA (pro)tracker library version 1.04

- Steve Flock SoundSystem library beta release

- Paul Reece Enhanced Music library update

- Nigel Hughes (RWE/RI)Maths/Chunky library beta release

- Ted Bailey Chunky-To-Planar includes beta release



---------------------------------------------------------
Bugs that have hopefully been squashed with this release:
---------------------------------------------------------

- NewTed's problems when running the program MCP (more of them)

- NewTed's problems with 'mouseable' labels

- Erm, well there were some fixes to four of the libraries in
  Acidlibs, but they're not included... (see BUM10docs)



-----------------
Floppy Disk Users
-----------------

This disk is a direct replacement for your Blitz2.1 program disk.

Please note that you will not be able to compile some of the examples
on the examples disks because they use additional commands contained
in the libraries on Blitzlibs. Blitz will report the error 'Token Not
Found' and the command will appear as ????? instead of text. See BUM9
for how to create a new deflibs.


There have been a few alterations to this disk to allow some more
room for Blitz libraries, however, the actual Blitz program files are
the same as on the BUM9 Blitz2 Program disk.

  - acidlibs          (unchanged from BUM9, grrr)

  - Blitz2 compiler   (unchanged from BUM9)

  - small defaultdbug (unchanged from BUM9)

  - Ted version 1.1   (unchanged from BUM9)


What has changed on this disk since BUM9 ?

  - Narrator.device has been removed from the 'devs' directory and
    Translator.library has been removed from the 'libs' directory.
    These two files handle the Amigas' speech facility, so the Blitz
    'speak' commands won't work if you boot from this disk. WB2+ users
    should format a blank disk as FFS (Fast Filing System) which will
    give them an extra 40K, then copy all the files from this disk onto
    it, and then replace the device and library if they want to use the
    speak commands.

  - Serial.device has also been removed from the 'devs' directory so
    you won't be able to use any Blitz serial commands if you boot from 
    this disk. 

  - The directory 'userlibs' contains a subdirectory 'beta' which 
    contains two Acid libraries, cd32lib from BUM8 and chunkylib from
    BUM9. These two libraries will load automatically when you first
    run Blitz. Normally, you would have received a larger Acidlibs 
    file containing these libraries, but there were big problems...
    (see BUM10docs)   

  - 'Small' Deflibs is slightly larger, it now contains the following
    libraries from Blitzlibs:
              
             - all the amigalibs  

             - elmore dos library v2.2 (Docs on BUM9)

             - elmore hardware library (Docs on BUM9)

             - xbones cia tracker library v1.04 

             - rwe/ri math library beta  

             - ri amos func library (Docs on BUM9)
	
    
---------------
Hard Disk Users
--------------- 

Due to extreme lack of space, the new editor and its' acidlib help
guides had to be packed into two lha archives and put on each BUM disk:

        Ted223.lha is on BUM10A 

        AcidGuides.lha is on BUM10B



So how do I install the new editor ?

     1. Rename your old Ted in your Blitz drawer, 'Ted21' will do..

     2. * VERY IMPORTANT STEP * - delete your old Ted preferences files
        from ENVARC: and ENV: or SuperTed2.23 will crash when you first
        run it! ENVARC: is on your Workbench partition (for WB3 users
        it's in Prefs/Env-Archive and for WB2 users it's erm, somewhere
        else I think ;), ENV: is in Ram: 

     3. Extract Ted223.lha directly into your Blitz drawer where your
        renamed OldTed and other Blitz program files are. This will create
        a new file 'Ted' and a new directory 'REDHelp' which contains a
        few script files and a sub-directory 'AcidGuides'

     4. Extract Acidguides.lha into the new directory,

        <your HD>:<your Blitz Drawer>/REDHelp/AcidGuides/

     5. Make sure the file attributes on the two files below, are set to
        S RWED (i.e. the Script flag is set)

        <your HD>:<your Blitz Drawer>/REDHelp/RED_HELP
        <your HD>:<your Blitz Drawer>/REDHelp/ShowExample

     6. Load Blitz and type a Blitz Command, 'DisplayControls' will do,
        press Right-Shift and Help on the same line as the command and
        if everything's ok the new help guides should pop up.



How do I make 'Lha' extract the files correctly ?

     1. Copy the files, 'Ted223.lha' from BUM10A and 'AcidGuides.lha' 
        from BUM10B to Ram:

     2. Open a CLI window and change the directory to your Blitz drawer
        by typing,

          Blitz2:                        <press return>
        
     3. Type,

          Lha -xa x Ram:Ted223.lha       <press return>

        the options -xa will extract the archive with the full path and
        with all file attributes preserved.

     4. Change the directory to your newly created drawer(s) by typing,

          Blitz2:REDHelp/AcidGuides/     <press return>

     5. Type,

          Lha -xa x Ram:AcidGuides.lha   <press return>



How do I change the file attributes of the two script files if I forgot
to set the -a option in 'Lha' ?

     1. Open a CLI window and change the directory to the new help drawer
        by typing, 

          Blitz2:REDHelp/         <press return>

     2. Type,

          Protect RED_HELP +s     <press return>

          Protect ShowExample +s  <press return>

     - Alternatively you can set a files attributes from Workbench by
       selecting show all files from the menus, then click once on the
       icon and select information from the menus.



Where's me BigDeflibs ?

     - There's no new BigDeflibs for you this time, just stick the new
       Blitzlibs: disk in your floppy drive and run the LibMan program
       from BUM9. You should end up with a 197K deflibs file (smaller
       than BUM9s' because the Acid chunkylib isn't included).

     - Don't forget to copy the two Acid library files (on this disk)
       into the same drawer on your HD.

            Blitz2:Userlibs/Beta/cd32lib.obj    
            Blitz2:Userlibs/Beta/chunkylib.obj  
        
       These libraries will now load automatically when you first run
       Blitz.




























It's all over...
