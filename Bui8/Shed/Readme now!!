INTRO
First off this is the Version I sent in the Amiga Format competition, so 
this version has been rushed like anything to get it finished by the end
of febuary 94.  So any improvements I've made since have not been 
implemented in this version, but instead ShEd V2 which is available from
me directly does have everything I have been improving and adding, I 
appolagise for lack of documentation.

HOW TO USE ShEd V1.1
Err... Trial and error?  No seriously you shouldn't have any serious 
problems running it, I've really tried to make it as logical as 
possible, but if you want a manual your gonna have to subscribe, sorry,
but I mean just look what you get...

WHATS THIS ABOUT ShEd V2?
ShEd V2 has had the user interface completely rearranged with the icons 
in more suitable places, on disk their should be 'shape-ed/V2Icons.iff'
this is a 16 col picture which shows what the new screen looks like, so
you know I'm not having you on.  As far as functions go, you've got 
even better grabbing functions Full Auto, Semi Auto and Manual.  Faster
Amos Bob conversion, more editing facilities, undo, airbrush, printing
facilities, no restrictions on size of shapes except for your Amiga's
memory.  Best of all I'm gonna give you fully annotated SOURCE CODE of
the whole thing, over 3000 lines of code.  Together with a laser 
printed manual, over 20 pages of information, then I'm gonna some how
squeeze ECLIPSE's latest game on their TRADER SPACE, a cross between
Elite and Defender. 

WOW!! I WANT SHED V2 NOW!!!
If you do want ShEd V2, to design or edit your shapes in, with the 
least possible fuss, all you need to do is send a £7 UK money made out
to Aaron Sethi, then I'll despatch your copy as soon as possible, I'll 
send you everything that I've mentioned above.  Then once registered 
with your own ECLIPSE member number, you'll have access to discounts 
on any future software we make....
Also if it isn't to much hassle could you send back your answers to
this questionnaire, that way I can tailor the editor to meet your
needs:
1. Why do you need a Shape Editor?
2. What method did you originally use to create your shapes?
3. Is their anything about this that cheeses you off?
4. What would be your ideal method for creating shapes, Neural
   Networked Brain Interfaces are not allowed?
5. What type of programs do you specialise in that require shapes?
6. What interface do you prefer to work with(Mouse, Icons, etc)?
7. Are their any repetitive processes that you have to carry out at
   the moment that you would like to see as a function/s?
8. Is there anything about a program that you have used in the past
   that has put you off it?
9. Is there anything about a program that has made you like it?
10. What functions do you regulary use?
11. What features do you want included in ShEd V2 coming to an Amiga
    near you in August 94?
12. Looking at the 'Shape-ed:Shape-ed/V2Icons.iff' picture what do
    you think of the new interface.
13. Would you miss the buggy, slow big screen if I ripped it out of
    V2, now that the main screen has 32x32 blocks?
14. What Amiga setup are you using?
15. Do you have a printer?
16. Do you have a Modem?
17. Would you like a small program that speaks revision notes whilst
    you sleep?

Thanks alot if you did bother with these questions, the more I find
out about my fellow Blitz Users the more I can do to help them....

WHAT SOFTWARE I USED NOT THAT YOU CARE!!
Blitz Basic 2 V1.80     Excellent!!
Amiga 500 plus 2MB      Sloooooowwwww
DPaintIV                Nifty
Capital 95.8 FM         More music, less chat
Edword & Transwrite     Hmmm...

DISCLAIMER
Although I try my best to rid my program of bugs, I accept no 
responsiblity for loss of data, or fried hardware, If you find a bug, 
Shape Editor users as well as me will be grateful if you report it and 
the circumstances under which it occurs. 

All critisms, suggestions, ideas, cash are gratefully welcome!!!
