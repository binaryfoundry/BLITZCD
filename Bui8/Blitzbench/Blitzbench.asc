			Authors note.
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BlitzBench is not a Workbench Alternative, allthough it might seem like it
at times. It was coded overnight (last night actualy), when my old PD
diskmenu-system realy got to me.
Having said this, i must allso add that coding a copy of Windows realy would
be simple. The Amiga has an Operating system that realy Ass.
Im truly looking forward to the RISC OS, a friend of mine in germany sent
me some snapshots of it, running WindowsNT!, And i guess we could emulate
the Macintosh as well with it.
You know what?  I have a feeling that all systems will merge into one, and
it can be the amiga. The amiga will soon get the power to use all other systems.
That means that amiga users can have access to some pretty stunning Pc/Mac
sofware!  (i cant wait to play Tie-fighter on my amiga).

But now back to our rusty old 020.. (that brought you back didnt it!)...


			What is BlitzBench?
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BlitzBench is an Icon based diskmenu system.
It has pre-defined Icons, and adapts itself to the drive it has been
executed from.
It also recognizes different filetypes by looking at the filenames.
If your files have a 3 character extension (.???) then a special icon
will be generated for that file.
Extensions supported	---->		.Gme   = Game.
					.Exe   = Program
					.Txt   = Textfile
					.Asc   = Textfile
					.Doc   = Textfile
					.font  = Fontfile
					.Iff   = Picture
					.Pic   = Picture

Blitzbench will also Exclude all .INFO files from its display, so unless your
program accesses the .info file directly, you can delete them from your drive.
BlitzBench changes the dospointer to your current path also.

			Why blitzBench?
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I got very tired of my old Diskmenu-system, not only did i have to install
every new program, so i could access them, but also it took up some
huge ammount of memory.
Most of the Diskmenu's i have tested do not manage to execute all types
of programs either, programs like Dpaint-AGA must be executed from
workbench. BlitzBench will execute 99% of all programs, and you dont have
to install their names first.
In the future, Blitzbench will send the Wbstartup signal to all files, for
100% support (if the program dosnt start without the signal first!).


		How does it work - And how do i use it?
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first thing BlitzBench does, is to steal the workbenchScreen's bitmap.
Dont worry, it wont fuzz-up anything, because it opens a window to cover
it up. And Workbench remembers its own look, so all will be restored when
you quit BlitzBench.
The reson for that i steal the Workbench Bitmap is obvious, to keep memory
usage to an absolute minimum.
Starting programs and opening drawers is simple, if an icon is selected
and you press it once again - then it will be started (if it was a file) or
opened (if it was a drawer) .

Whenever you go into a drawer, an arrow sign will be displayed to the left
of the screen. This arrow means 'Parent' directory, or in plain - If you press
the arrow, you will go back to the previous directory.
It will only be displayed if you have moved away from the root.

BlitzBench needs the following files:

			Diskfont.library - in the Libs Drawer.
			Bbench.Tab	 - On the root directory.

It also needs an assign to "ENV:", if you dont have any Env files, then
simply assign ENV: to ram.



				Notes!
				~~~~~~
*BlitzBench will not start from workbench.
*I havent tested it on other machines than my A1200+HD.
*BlitzBench and files must be on the root directory (SYS: / Dh0: etc..)
*Display is limited to 40 files per drawer.


For flames, bugs or if you want to register yourself to a 100% version,
i do accept sales to magazines(!), and will re-code the system for such
use. Write to:				Jon Lennart Berg
