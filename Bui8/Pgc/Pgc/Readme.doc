Platform Games Core By R.Sutcliffe May 1996

This is something I've been working on for a few months on and off. It's
a core sequence of routines for handling characters in Platform games.
So far it can handle animation of characters, Baddies and the main
character.

The little demo it comprises of consists of a single screen, three platforms
with baddies walking on them , and a ladder. All the features included work,
although collision detection is a bit cumbersome and dosesn't work too well.
Three features I have intended to add but not got around to doing yet are
falling blocks (called crumble blocks in the listing), background animation
(called animblocks) and collectables. It will probably be winter before I
can get around to them now.

The heart of this system depends on two background map arrays - one is
the array created by the map editor which draws the background onto the
bitmap, the second is a virtual map array which is used by the program
to determine what the main character is standing on. For this demo the
virtual map is derived from the background map. For more complex games
the virtual map could be created seperatly, as more block types could
be added, eg hidden blocks, hidden doors and entrances to bonus rooms etc.,
whick would not be visible on the screen.

There are three programs in this release - PGC.bb is the Platform game
core itself, PGC.h is a header file which defines the constants and newtypes
which is used to create the resident file. This is well documented and
should be looked at if you wish to understand the main listing
(particularly the notes on variable naming at the foot of the header file.).
The third program - sin.bb was used to develop the offsets for the jump
routine.
