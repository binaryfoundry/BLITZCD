    LibNum = 15 (In development)

    Developed by: Michael Milne of SUNTEAM

    Purpose: To allow the easy use of BG mapping commands for storage of
             BG info.


    Version: 1.00 (10/10/94) Basic init routine and info fetching.
             1.01 (26/10/94) Plotting and Getting added.


    Future developments to come:
             1.10 (??/??/??) Loading & Saving of maps as files.
             1.11 (??/??/??) De-Cludging of maps from memory.
             1.20 (??/??/??) Autodraw of maps to a screen.


    COMMANDS:

            InitMap width,height
            MapWidth
            MapHeight
            MapAdr
            MapLen
            MapPlot X,Y,Value
            MapGet(X,Y)




    PRELUDE: With these routines you can setup a simple map structure (Only
             one!) for use with BG programming as originally seen in TOME for
             A**S.


**** InitMap ****

    Syntax: InitMap width,height
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: This command initialises the map. All you need to supply is
             the width of the map and the height.


**** MapWidth ****

    Syntax: width.w=MapWidth
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: To retrieve the width of a map at any time.  If a '0' is
             returned then the map is not initialised yet.


**** MapHeight ****

    Syntax: height.w=MapHeight
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: Just as MapWidth except it retrieves the height instead.


**** MapAdr ****

    Syntax: adr.l=MapAdr
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: It returns the address of the map in mem. Used for debugging
             but I couldn't be bothered to remove it.


**** MapLen ****

    Syntax: len.l=MapLen
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: Again another debugging tool for me. Returns the length in
             bytes of the map.


**** MapPlot ****

    Syntax: MapPlot X,Y,Value
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: To plot a value at a given coordinate in the map (Perhaps the
             value representing a shape id!).


**** MapGet ****

    Syntax: val.w=MapGet(X,Y)
    Modes:  Amiga/Blitz

    Purpose: To return the value found at the given coordinates in the map.
