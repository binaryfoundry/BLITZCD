                     Virtual Worlds Beta Toast Version
                                   V1.009
                              Updated 16/5/94

             A RECORD OF UPDATES IS IN THE HELP FILE VW.GUIDE

Hello!

      Please do note that this version of Virtual Worlds is a pre-release
version, so any bugs will (hopefully) be fixed by the time the full release
is completed.  Just a few notes to be made though :-

           o If you use a hard disk boot from that and run the install
             program.  You can delete the ASL directory afterwards if you
             want to save disk space.  If you do this then EVERYTHING will
             be set up for you - all ready to go.  An option to install to
             floppy disk should arrive soon.
             EVERYTHING that came out of the archive can be deleted if you
             want because EVERYTHING will have been set up for you.
             The Installer program is provided for you - I dont know how many
             people have this, and certainly people with floppy drives are 
             unlikely to posses it.
             Otherwise...
              o If you want icons saved with data files then bung the VWProject
                icon into your s: drawer.  A config file will be put in there by
                VW the first time you boot as well.
              o Put VirtualWorlds + VW.gfx in a drawer and assign VW: to it.
              o If you dont have a times font or yours doesnt like Virtual
                Worlds then copy the times font from the font draw.
              o If you dont have asl.library then copy the correct version
                to your libs: drawer -> call it ASL.LIBRARY.
                Also -> check that you dont already have a newer version number!
           o The online help will only work if AmigaGuide or MultiView is in
             your sys:utilities drawer.  (AmigaGuide is available on Aminet
             in a fish disk.)
           o ASL.LIBRARY MUST be present in LIBS: to run Virtual Worlds.
           o Floppy disk users should boot from a copy of Workbench, ensuring
             that an appropriate version of ASL.LIBRARY is in the libs drawer
             of your boot disk.  Final version will be supplied as an archive
             that can install itself to a boot disk.
           o PLEASE let me know if you let anyone else use VW, and PLEASE give
             me a bit of feedback - if you detest VW then TELL ME!  I need to
             know what you like and dislike so I can make any progress.
           o Give me some kind of report (if you can) including :-

                  Machine Running On
                  KickStart Version
                  AGA/ECS/OLD Gfx Chipset
                  Free Mem + Fast Mem
                  Hard Disk size
                  Extra drives + other peripherals

             And say whether it works of course!  A quick mention of things
             you like/dislike/want would be greatly appreciated.
             If you have found a bug before and its still there - tell me 
             again!  I have a mind like a sieve, so keep reminding me if its
             not been sorted out!  >BUG ME IF VW IS BUGGING YOU<


   Everything else is pretty much self explanatory, but I ought to mention what
ISNT in there so that you dont come running back and complain about it!

      ALL THESE WILL GO IN AT SOME POINT :-

   Exits can be opened/closed
   Effects - I know what I want - I just have to sit down and do it now!
   then I write an interpreter,
   and the Interface option in conjunction with that
   then I add the population.
   Then if im feeling adventurous Ill make it so you can do Monkey Island style
      things.

   Feel free to suggest anything you feel I have missed / should include.
There is a large possibility of an in-line editor as well at a later date.

   By the way, the parser is actually written now - It can understand multiple
sentences, as in ;

   Get the smellly dog and eat it then throw it up. Jump on the disgusting puke
and splash it over the black cat,white mouse and rotten pineapple and then blow
the silver trumpet loudly.

   YES - you can discern between adverbs if you really want to!
And YES - That sentence will quite happily be split into its component parts
- if you want to throw a few nasty ones at me I'll make sure they work.  Up
to 50 parts can be used ( as in GET DOG. EAT IT. THROW IT UP.).
And YES - adjectives are recognised, even though you dont put them in!  Call
an item "BLACK FLUFFY CAT" and it will recognise any number of correct
adjectives previous to the last word (the noun).  If it gets two matches, ie
you enter BUTTON when there is a red and green button it will ask which one.
Neat Eh?

   PS: If anyone can point me in the right direction for how to get the tooltype
       info out of an icon i would be rather grateful - Blitz2 says NOTHING
       about it!  Oh well.  Byeeeeee.
