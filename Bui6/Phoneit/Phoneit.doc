PhoneIt V1.3 - Steve White 1994


PhoneIt: Introduction

PhoneIt is an easy-to-use name and phone storage program. I wrote this program
because, although there are many database programs around none of them seemed
instantly accessible.
	PhoneIt is small in size (around 30K PowerPacked) and is specifically
designed to deliver names and phone numbers with the minimum amount of fuss.
	This, I feel it does extremely well. As I really don't have enough
time to learn assembly language Blitz Basic 2 from Acid Software seemed the
language to use.
	The program itself uses a handsome user-interface made up of clearly
labelled buttons and indicators. The interface has been kept as small as
possible in order not to clutter up the Workbench screen. Every button has a
keyboard equivalent so you hardly need to use the mouse at all.


PhoneIt: Shareware Notice

PhoneIt is shareware. I don't expect to be paid for it (would I be anyway?)
but it would be nice to get some feedback from users.
	However, you will not be able to Print or use Tool Types from this
version as it is the unregistered version.
	If you want to receive the registered version of PhoneIt which will
allow you to use the Print option and Tool Types you should send a disk and a
cheque for £2.50 made payable to S A White and send it to following address:

(Please don't phone)

Your name will be present in the Help window to confirm your registration.
	Your address will be stored and you will be told of any future
versions of PhoneIt. All you need to do then is send a disk, altering the
address to read PhoneIt Update and I will copy the new version and send it out
to you free of charge.
NOTE: The registered version will be sent when your cheque has cleared!

PhoneIt: System requirements

PhoneIt will happily run on any Amiga with Kickstart 2.04 or greater. The only
files that PhoneIt needs in order to function is the font Peridot and the
loader picture called PhoneItPic. The font should be copied into the FONTS:
directory. The PhoneItPic should be present in the same directory as the
PhoneIt program. As PhoneIt is packed using PowerPacker you will need the
powerpacker.library and asl.library (for the file requesters) in your LIBS:
drawer. If you intend to use the Print option and you are running PhoneIt from
a floppy disk make sure you have the necessary printer files. And that's it!


PhoneIt: Installation

To install PhoneIt simply copy it across to a location on your hard drive or
floppy disk. Make sure you have a FONTS: directory as you will need to copy
the Peridot font into it. Copy the PhoneItPic file to the same directory as
the main PhoneIt program. Make sure you have the powerpacker.library and
asl.library present in the LIBS: drawer.


PhoneIt: Using PhoneIt

PhoneIt is extremely easy to use and requires little explanation. The main
control panel is divided into three sections - the data entry windows, the
main control buttons and the movement buttons.
	PhoneIt starts on Card 1 of 1 which is displayed in the boxes
alongside the Phone gadget. PhoneIt can hold up to 200 cards (who needs more
than 200?) and you can add more cards by clicking the Add button or pressing
key A. New cards are added at the end of the last card.
	Likewise, cards can be deleted by clicking on the Delete button or
pressing the Del key. Delete erases the current card and shifts those after up
one position.
	PhoneIt files can be saved and loaded by clicking on the Save and Load
buttons or by pressing the keys S and L. PhoneIt files are given the extension
.pi to distinguish them from other files. A new PhoneIt file can be created by
clicking on the New button or by pressing the N key. You can also print out
your PhoneIt files by clicking the Print button or pressing P.
	The Quit button is fairly self-explanatory. If you have not made any
changes to the present file when you quit, new or load the effect will be
immediate. If changes have been made you will be asked to confirm these
options.
	The buttons on the far-right control movement around the present
PhoneIt file. The arrow buttons from left to right are move to first card,
move to previous card, move to next card and move to last card. Movement can
also be controlled via the cursor keys. If movement is beyond the dimensions
of the file the screen will flash and you may hear a warning sound. Sort
simply arranges the cards alphabetically and can also be controlled by
pressing key R. Goto will allow you to enter a valid card number. When you
click on the Okay button the main display will be changed to reflect your
selection. Goto can also be selected with key G.
	The Search button allows you to search for specific criteria either in
the Name gadget or Phone gadget. You can select the type of search by clicking
on the appropriate button. PhoneIt will search the fields and match them
against whatever you typed in. The Search facility IS case sensitive. Quit
returns you back to the main control panel.

PhoneIt: Notes

PhoneIt looks in the S: directory when saving or loading files.

If other applications are open when PhoneIt is quit one of them will be made
the current screen. I'll try and sort this in a later version.

You MUST hit Return after typing in a Name or Phone for PhoneIt to store it
successfully. This is NOT a bug.

I wanted to be able to display the filename of the presently loaded PhoneIt
file in the main display window bar but the command to do this - WTITLE
seems to have some nasty side effects when file input or output is used. This
is a bug in Blitz Basic I think (Not good having bugs in a programming
language). I'll try and add this if I can at a later date.

The Sort option sorts the Name fields into alphabetical order. Only the first
character of each name is sorted. I'll try and improve the Sort so that it
checks the second characters also and maybe an option to sort from the Phone
fields. As it is, the Sort command is adequate for most people's use.


That's just about it. Enjoy the program.

PhoneIt V2.0

Version 2.0 of PhoneIt is now ready for registered users. The improvements
over version 1.3 are massive and require extensive explanation.
	Apart from the fact that you can use the Print option the program
has been almost totally redesigned. A list and explanation of all the new
improvements is available below:


***S:PhoneIt.defaults***
PhoneIt now includes a special defaults file that always resides in the S:
directory. This file holds information about how PhoneIt should load. If
this file does not exist one is created when you save Preferences from the
Preferences window or snapshot the X and Y positions of the iconified window
(See below).
	The file holds four important elements;

1. The default phone file that PhoneIt should load when run. If you want a
particular phone file loaded automatically then type its path and name here.
You can also set this in the Prefs window activated by clicking the Prefs
button on the PhoneIt main display

2. The STARTUP option. If this line reads STARTUP then PhoneIt will load
as an iconified window. This is useful if you don't want PhoneIt to load its
main display. The iconified window has two buttons in it - Run PhoneIt and SS.
The Run PhoneIt button opens the main PhoneIt window. The SS button
snapshots the X and Y positions of the iconified window and saves them to
the S:PhoneIt.defaults file. The main PhoneIt display can be iconified by
clicking on the Iconify button.

3. The X position of the iconified window. This can be set by clicking the
SS button on the iconified window or from the Prefs window. If X is greater
than the physical dimensions of your Workbench minus the length of the
iconified window then X will be set as far right as is possible.

4.The Y position of the iconified window. This can be set by clicking the
SS button on the iconified window or from the Prefs window. If Y is greater
than the physical dimensions of your Workbench minus the height of the
iconified window then Y will be set to 0.


***Fax Field***
PhoneIt now incorporates a Fax field so that you can enter any relevant fax
numbers. The Search button allows you to search in the Fax field.


***Notes Field***
As well as a Fax field PhoneIt also has a Notes field in which you can enter
any relevant information about that particular file. The Notes button is
on the main PhoneIt display and also indicates which files have Notes. If
there is a >>> to the left of the Notes button then that particular file
includes information in the Notes field. Click on the Notes button to open
the Notes window. The Search buttons allows you to search in the Notes field.


***Windows***
All the windows now include depth and close gadgets and all can be dragged.
The close gadget basically acts as a cancel.


***Search***
The Search facility has now been improved considerably. Not only can you
search in the Fax and Notes fields but the search will look through entire
field contents, not just the beginning. You may have a Name field
containing Joe Bloggs but all you can remember is loggs. If you type in
loggs in the Name field PhoneIt will find the file Joe Bloggs. The results
of the Search are also displayed in the main PhoneIt window.


***Preferences***
You can now customise PhoneIt using the Prefs button. The Preferences
window allows you to alter the default phone file, turn the STARTUP option
on or off and alter the X and Y positions of the iconified window. If you
can't remember the name of the default phone file you can click on the
requester button to the right of the Auto Load: field and select one. Any
incorrect settings entered in the S:PhoneIt.defaults file will be ignored.


***Keys***
All of the keyboard shortcuts are now accessed via the RightA key. This
brings PhoneIt's keyboard shortcuts in line with other Amiga applications.
For a full list of all keyboard shortcuts check out the Help windows
accessed via the Help button on the main PhoneIt display. Each button has its
corresponding key underlined also.


***Print***
The Print option prints out PhoneIt files in the following way:


PhoneIt: <Registered name>

<Name01>----<Phone01>----<Fax01>
<Name02>----<Phone02>----<Fax02>
<Name03>----<Phone03>----<Fax03>

etc.
If there is not a Fax available then the printout will be:

<Name01>----<Phone01>----<Fax01>
<Name02>----<Phone02>
<Name03>----<Phone03>----<Fax03>

etc.


***Bugs***
The few bugs that there were have been fixed. There may be others but only
time will tell and a bit of hands-on experience.


***Auto-loading***
If you want to make PhoneIt load successfully everytime you boot your Amiga
you will need to add the following line to your S:Startup-Sequence or
S:User-Startup:

run >NIL: <Path>PhoneIt



That's it, have fun.

***Things to do for V3.0***

1. I would like to incorporate the S:PhoneIt.defaults into the PhoneIt icon's
Tool Types. Blitz Basic 2 doesn't support Tool Types as of yet but as soon
as it does I will sack the S:PhoneIt.defaults file altogether.

2. I may consider improving the Sort option so that it sorts alphabetically
by the first three characters and not just the first. Hopefully Acid
Software will consider a command to sort a string dimension instead of just
numerical ones.

3. I'd like to change the >>> indicator to something more appropriate in the
future. Perhaps a CheckBox that cannot be toggled manually or an arrow of
some description.

4. The shrink window gadget can not be present without a resize gadget. As
I did not want a resize gadget the iconified PhoneIt window has to have a
button to expand the window (Run PhoneIt) as does the main display to iconify
it. Provided Acid Software add a resize gadget option to Blitz basic 2 I will
include this instead of iconify and expand buttons.

5. I'm trying desperately to stop PhoneIt bringing any multitasking
applications to the front when it is quit. This isn't a major problem but I
WANT to fix it. I can't tell yet whether it can be done but I just don't
know how or if it is a quirk with Blitz Basic 2. I'll keep trying...  


***End***
