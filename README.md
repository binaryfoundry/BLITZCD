This CD originally came from archive.org but the installer would not work. A patch has been applied from the following forum thread so that the installer completes properly.

## Acid Software

I have not been in contact with Acid directly for their approval, but the CD is present on archive.org and I felt it needed preserving properly. I will take down the repo if they object to it.
