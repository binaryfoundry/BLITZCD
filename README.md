# Blitz Basic 2 Ultimate CD

This CD originally came from archive.org but the installer would not work. A patch has been applied from the following forum thread so that the installer completes properly.

## Usage

Select this directory as a hard drive in WinUAE/FS-UAE as BLITZCD, run the installer.

### ASCII Source Files

Some .bb2 files have been converted to ASCII to be readable outside of TED the Blitz editor, however this will break INCLUDE directives so included files will need to be saved in Blitz format again to work.

Commit 56da8 updates the Deflibs file which corrects some unknown tokens loaded from .bb2 binary source files appearing as '?????'.

## Manual

A PDF scan of the Blitz Basic 2.1 manual has been included from the English Amiga Board forums.

## Acid Software

I have not been in contact with Acid directly for their approval, but the CD is present on archive.org and I felt it needed preserving properly. I will take down the repo if they object to it.
