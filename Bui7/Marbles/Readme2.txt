or write to me incase I  ever  need  a  favour in the future. I
have just up loaded a whole batch of files to aminet. Here is a
list of the archive names  I  strongly  recommend you down load
them.

Fireflies_B.lha -  Large  version  of  my  game  Fireflies this
contains an  animated  intro.  I  Very  strongly  recommend you
download this before you do anything else. Fireflies is a one -
five player simultaneous game. It has real gravity, nice sound,
gameplay is similar to  Biplanes.   (must  be  placed on a disk
called "fireflies")

Fireflies.lha -  Same  as  above  but  with  no  graphic intro.
archived it is only 65K and takes very little time to down load
so you have got no excuse. Once you have it spread it about the
world a much and a quickly as  humanly possible. Give a copy to
anyone you know with any Amiga.  (it  must  be placed on a disk
called "fireflies" to work)  It  can  currently  be down loaded
from the game/2game directory of aminet.

Manfred.lha - A joystick controllable character with 350 frames
of animation. He will be appearing in many of my future games.

Almost.lha - An animation  featuring  Manfred combining D-Paint
animation  and  Imagine  rendering.  The  animation  is  played
through a compiled Blitz 2 program. (must be depacked to a disk
called "anims")

City.lha - Similar style  to  above  but  in  the  style of the
Micro-chasm intro. (must be depacked to a disk called "anims")

The_Chase - 370 frame 32 colour animation featuring Manfred.

Manfred_Obj.lha - Imagine 3.0 object.

Manfred_Pic.lha - 32 colour rendering

Snow_Pic.lha - 24-Bit highres Imagine Render of Snowmen.

Agent_Obj.lha - Imagine  3.0  object  for  a  James  Bond style
character. Do not redistribute any  files contain renderings of
these two characters with out my expressed permission.

Boulder_anim.lha - 254 frame D-Paint animation demonstrating an
idea for a level of a future game.

Pult.lha - 144 frame  D-Paint  animation  demonstrating an idea
for a level of a future game.

TrouBall.lha - 335 frame D-Paint animation similar to above.

Marbles_Blitz.lha - seven precompiled  programs  + source code.
One of the programs is  for  real  time  ball  movement in a 3D
landscape with joystick  control,  real  time  shadow  and real
gravity. Other programs  are  for  texture  mapped towers. Real
time fire works. Simulated universes and many others. (you must
rename the disk these files are  on as "marbles" before running
programs).

3D_Snow.lha generates 10's of  1000's  of snowflakes which fall
in a 3D environment.  You  can  alter  things  such  a wind and
gravity and the number  of  flakes.  (this  disk must be called
snow for it to work).

All programs are by Philip  Holden  please  E-mail me to let me
know you have down loaded these files.

FIREFLIES

As far as I  know  this  game  is  totally  original due to the 
obscure nature of  its  conception.  The  game  is deliberately 
simple so I could get  it  finished  working on my own.

In this game you have to kill  all your rival male Fireflies to
further your chances of mating.

On your first go I  suggest  you  ignore the options just press 
return many times on the options screen.

You should be on the game screen  now, in fact if you are still 
reading this then you are probably  dead. Press return to start 
the next round.


CONTROLS:

                  fly up                      /----\
                                              |Fire|  dive down
                    ^                         \----/  on the
                    I                                 closest
     fly left   <---+--->   have a guess              opponent
                    I
                    v

                 fly down


There should be  two  fireflies   on  the  screen  one computer 
controlled and the other controlled  by  you. You must kill the 
computers one to do this you must  fly above him then dive down 
on him.

When two Fireflies collide the  one  moving  down fasted at the 
time of  collision  will  knock  the  other  unconscious.  If a 
firefly flies to close to  the  water  it  may  be eaten by the 
fish. The kingfisher on  the  branch  indicates the position of 
the fish.  The frog will also kill if you are not careful. Just 
see that you opponent comes to  some serious harm. Keep playing 
until you can beat the computer.

You can have up  to  five  players.  As you play you might find 
it fun to punch  your  opponent if  he kills you. For more than 
three players  you  will  need   a  four player adaptor in your 
parallel port. I have  not tested  this option yet because I do 
not own an adaptor  or    four    working  joysticks (so it may 
not work).  The fire  button  will  allow  you to swoop towards 
the nearest attackable firefly.


I have included the source  code also.

About the author:

Interests
Mental:

1) Computing -  animation,  programming,  AI,  3D rendering and
just generally replicating and bending physics.
2) Cutting edge science  -  The  future  of  mass storage, nano
technology,  holograms,   pseudo   3D,   super   dense   atoms,
fundamental particles and the workings of the brain.
3) Wildlife - Flying squirrels, ants slow worms & pond life.
4) French bangers -  what haven't we done with them.
5) Performing  -  Although  sometimes  quite  shy  I  do  enjoy
performing  on stage. I have got  through  to the finals of the
school spoken English twice  and  won  it  once.  I would enjoy
pushing products and ideas publicly.
6) Advertising - I have an instinctive desire to impress, would
love influencing people. I would  like  to bring advertising to
the games industry in  a  way  that  the product placement just
adds atmosphere or the ads  are  so  good they just enhance the
product. I firmly  believe  total  sponsorship  to  be the only
sensible way of funding  link up game with hundreds of players.
It also turns Piracy into  a  good  thing  rather than it being 
bad.
8) Space the moon and quantum physics.
9) The paranormal - magnetic resinance, spoon bending & UFO's
10) Dreaming.

Physical:

1) Skiing - I just love it (specially black runs).
2) Climbing - very good fun.
3) Badminton and Squash - good convenient fun.
4) Generally hanging from things - I'd love to do my own motion
capture stunts. I can hang from my arms (only) continuously for
five minuets. I can also hang from  one arm and juggle with two
balls in the other hand.
5) Building and being the first  to  test  a 24 foot high death
slide made from a length  of  rope  and  a plastic  water pipe.
Also 5 people on a rope swing over a stream was fun.
6) Cycling - we live in  the  bottom  of a valley so where ever
you go is up hill I  can  now  cycle  up Kit Hill (two miles of
solid steep up hill) with out stopping.
7) Cycling down Kit Hill.
8) Snorkelling - sea cucumbers, squid, eels and crabs.


I respect:

Animation 
1) Aardman Animation - Loves Me, Loves Me Not
2) Nick park -  A  Grand  Day  Out, Archy's Concrete Nightmare,
Creature Comforts, The Wrong Trousers & A Close Shave.
3) The Sandman - A scary animation  this to horror what a Grand
Day out is to comedy.
4) Blindscape - This depicts  a  blind  man stumbling through a
forest, puts its point across very well.
5) Manipulation - Good Oscar winning stuff.
6) The Cat Came Back - Funny.


MUSIC

[Sleeper]: (Louise Wener),  I should  be going to see them live
at Bristol Anson Rooms.

Crowded House: Private Universe  is  prehaps the best song ever
written.

Pulp: Very good a performing.

Britpop in general.


Comedy
1) Jeremy Hardy - A  public  speaker  just  breaking into TV (a
good friend of Jack Dee). His first book "When did you last see
your father" is incredibly funny.  So  was  the first Radio 1 &
Radio 4 series Jeremy Hardy Speaks To The Nation.
2) Black Adder - This did for sarcasm what Monty Python did for
the surreal.
3) Monty Python - You probably know them.
4) Faulty Towers - Genius
4) Whose Line Is It Anyway - Ryan Styles is very funny.
5) Have I Got News For You - Getting a bit old now.
6) Alan  Partridge,  The  Day  Today  and  The  Saturday  Night
Armistice - all these have the  same  people in and behind them
these people should now make a film.
7) Fist Of Fun  -  The  last  few  episodes  of the first radio
series was brilliant. Then came the new controller of Radio One 
and the next two radio   series   were   not  very good. The TV 
series was OK but  tended  to  repeat  radio material. They are
also good friends with people behind 6).
8) The Young Ones - and Bottom.
9) Red Dwarf - nice.

Film

1) The Dark Crystal - very  strong  story line and just so many
nice touches. A very well conceived world, brilliant characters
(none of the mutant humanoid rubbish which has become so common
now).
2) Monty Python Films - You must have seen them.
3) Jason and The Argonauts & Clash  of The Titans - very strong
stories, told well.
4)  Time  Bandits  -  Brilliant   observational  humour  superb 
escapist plot.
5) Dead Poets Society - Sad.
6) Box of Delights - very good BBC drama.

TV Stations
Channel 4 & BBC 2: Good stuff.

Disk World Novels
Roald Dahl
