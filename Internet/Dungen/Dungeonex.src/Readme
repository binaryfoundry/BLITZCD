Short:        source for Dungeon Explorer game
Uploader:     camge@ix.netcom.com
Author:       Curt Esser
Type:         dev/blitz
Requires:     Blitz Basic
              games/role/DungeonEx.lha (if you want to compile and run it)
Distribution: Freely distributable

 This is the Blitz source code for my Dungeon Explorer game.
Source for the room editor is also included.  This is a simple multi-tasking
game with animation, sound, and music.  You may find something in here you
can use.  If you wish to compile the game, you will also need the data files for
the graphics, sounds, and music which are not included here.  You will need to
download the game itself from games/role to get these.  You may use and distribute
this source as you wish, however DO NOT distribute re-compiled versions of the
whole game without my permission!
 If you like the icons, you can find a whole set of Blitz icons on Aminet in
the pix/icon drawer (actually 2 sets, one for Magic Workbench and one for
NewIcons)

Later,

Curt
