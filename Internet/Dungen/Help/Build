   Build will randomly generate dungeon levels based upon how you have
set everything up. When you perform a build, the display will show the
level being generated and the pass number. Each pass represents one attempt
to draw all the rooms, the doors, and the halls between rooms. This display
may not stay on the screen long enough to even see if you have a small
number of rooms in proportion to the width and height set for the level.
Room Min and Max can effect this as well. If you are trying to draw 15
rooms with a max width of 20 in a 30 X 30 dungeon it may not do so well. If
the generating process reaches 99 passes and does not succeed, a requester
will pop up asking if you wish to keep the levels that were drawn. If you
answer yes, the next build will start at the level which failed. A no
response will erase all levels.
