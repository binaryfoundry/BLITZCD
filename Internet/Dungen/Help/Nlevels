   N Levels sets the number of levels you want to have randomly built or to
have available in the editor. This field will also determine what values
can be displayed in the Level and Range fields. These fields cannot have a
value greater than N Levels.
   When clicking on the arrow buttons to change the value, a left click
changes it by 1 and a right click changes it by 5.
