   This saves your work as an IFF file. It will append the level number to
the file name you supply and save each level as a separate image. When
checking for file overwrites, only the 1st level is checked for. For
example if you give a save name of "Test" it will check to see if a file
named "Test1" exists. Keep this in mind if you are saving a 10 level
dungeon and make sure you don't have some file named "Test9" in the
directory that you don't wish to have overwritten. The program is set up
this way because it would be rather annoying to save a 20 level dungeon in
IFF format, then make some changes and want to save it again with the same
name. You would have to answer the "Overwrite File?" requester 20 times!
But it would be even more annoying to write over a file you wanted to keep.
So check the file names in the directory first please.
