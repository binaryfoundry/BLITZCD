   The wall brushes and door brushes can change their orientation to the
mouse pointer by using the cursor keys. The wall brushes can be toggled in
2 directions and the door brushes can toggle in all 4 directions.
   To use the text brush, click on the square you want to label. The brush
will disappear. Enter the character or Alt-character on the keyboard and it
will be printed to the screen. Characters are the only graphic that cannot
share the same dungeon square with other non structural graphics (door,
stair, pit). You can load the dungen.font into a font editor and create your
own graphics.
   The effect of the eraser brush will vary depending which mouse button
you click on it with. A left click will make a brush that will delete the
graphics, but leave a scale dot. A right click makes a brush which will
erase everything.
