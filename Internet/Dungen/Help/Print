   You will need to set some of the printing parameters within Workbench
Preferences. These are density, horizontal or vertical aspect, and perhaps
some others if you wish. The two most important are the density and the
aspect though.

   Horizontal aspect: This will give you smaller images and is better if
you want to print more than one image per page. Even if you select Max X or
Max Y, the image will not be as large as the dungeon appears on the screen.

   Vertical aspect: Produces larger images in general. If you set the Max X
or Y buttons, the printout will be close to the same size as the screen
image (at least this is the case with a Cannon BJ200e). Due to the huge
number of printers and drivers out there, I'm just not sure whether this
will be true in all cases. Experiment with the settings and let me know how
your printouts turn out.

   Pressing the Esc key will exit the print requester.
