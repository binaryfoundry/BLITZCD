   Range can be useful if you are working on a dungeon with many levels.
There are 10 ranges available which is probably overkill, but what the
heck. The current range number is displayed to the right of the Range
button. The fields below the Range button are used to set the levels
included in the current range. If these fields cannot be changed, it's
because N Levels is set to 1. The starting level cannot be greater than the
ending level in a range. So you can have a range of 3 to 7 but not one from
6 to 2. Say you have N Levels set for 20 and Level set for 1. You set up
the first level to be 20 X 20, 10 rooms, and the min and max where you want
it. If you want the first 4 levels to be the same, click the Range End
field until it displays 4. Then click the Copy To Range button. This saves
you the time of setting all the fields for each individual level. Click
to Range number 2 and you could set that for example from levels 5 to 10.
By having multiple ranges, you can make quick changes later if the build
process does not go the way you want and adjustments are needed.
   When clicking on the arrow buttons to change the value, a left click
changes it by 1 and a right click changes it by 5.
