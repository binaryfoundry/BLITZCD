   This is a tool for gamemasters to take some of the work out of preparing
for their game. It is faster than drawing maps with a ruler by hand. Much
faster if you are content to use some of the randomly generated maps.
   I've included the ability to save your work in IFF format in case you
need to use a paint program to add additional components; or if you have
a color printer and want to add something other than B&W elements.
   Experiment with generating just one level at first. Adjust the width,
height and room parameters until you get a feel for how they affect the
look of the floorplans.
   Pressing the Esc key is an alternate way to exit the Help screen. The
Esc key is also the way to exit from the editor back to the control panel.
