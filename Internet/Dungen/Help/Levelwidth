   Level Width sets the width for the current level. The unit of
measurement is arbitrary. For AD&D® each unit would probably be considered
10 feet. So a level that is 33 X 33 is 330 ft X 330 ft. Different game
systems or personal preference can dictate each unit to be whatever you
wish.
   When clicking on the arrow buttons to change the value, a left click
changes it by 1 and a right click changes it by 5.
