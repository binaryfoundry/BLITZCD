   Copy To All takes the values for Level Width, Level Height, Rooms, Room
Min and Room Max currently displayed, and copies them to all levels. Note
that "all levels" is the number of levels you have set in the N Levels
field. If you have N Levels set for 10 and you press Copy To All, the
current level's values will be copied to levels 1 through 10. If you
subsequently increase the value of N Levels, everything over level 10 will
contain the default values.
