   Copy To Range takes the values for Level Width, Level Height, Rooms,
Room Min and Room Max currently displayed, and copies them to the current
Range (there are 10 ranges available). If you have multiple levels you wish
to have the same set of values for, Copy To Range can make it go a lot
faster than changing the settings for each level one at a time.
