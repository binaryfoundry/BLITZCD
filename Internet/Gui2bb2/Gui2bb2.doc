------------------------------------------------------------------

Prolog
~~~~~~
GUI2BB2  is  a  tool for GadToolsBox (GTB).  GTB is written by Jan
van  den Baard and it is used to create grafic user interfaces for
programs.    The  programs  then  use  menus  and  gadget  of  the
gadtools.library, which is included in the AmigaOs since V2.0.  In
this  way  created  user  interfaces,  can be convert by GTB, into
ASM-,  C-  or  OBERON-sources.  It is also possible to save into a
kind  of  IFF-File.   The  used  format has nothing to do with the
IFF-Grafix-Format   !    GUI2BB2   convert   this   IFF-File  into
BlitzBasicII  Sourcecode.  It uses the gadtools-commands, wich are
included since BB2-V1.6


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There  is  not much to install.  Just copy the program to a place,
where you will find it, when you need it :-)


Using
~~~~
You  can  start  GUI2BB2 from CLI or from Workbench.  After start,
the  programmwindow  will be displayed.  The window is splittet in
four  parts.   In the upper part you can say, wich elements of the
gui-File  should  be  convertet.   You can also change the kind of
source  you  want  create  for  screen  and  windows  (normal-  or
taglistversion)
In  the left-middle part you can choose the source and destination
filenames.   Under  the  "?"  buttons,  you find ASL-Requesters to
choose the filenames.
In   the   right-middle  part  you  can  do  some  actions.
With  "Start-GTB"  you  start the GadToolsBox-Programm.  First you
have   to   edit  Prefs  !!!!   If  GUI-File  does  not  exist,  a
standard-gui-file will be created, before starting GTB.
With  the  "Convert"  button, you start the converting of GUI-File
into BB2-File.
With  "Edit-BB2"  you  start  the  Texteditor  for the BB2-Source.
First you have to edit Prefs !
With "Prefs" you open the Prefs-window.
In the lower part, the programm will display messages and infos.


Misc
~~~~
GUI2BB2  create and use a config-file (s:gui2bb2.pref).  It`s just
a simple ascii-text-file, wich includes path- and filenames.


Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
Only  screens,  windows,  gadgets  and bevelboxes will be convert.
Menus  will  not  be convert.  Also the used fonts in the gui-file
