This stuff is a very first test for a DOOM-Raycasting-engine.
Made in BlitzBasic 2 with a ASM-object included.

Before you can try the sourcecode in BB2, you must reset your
Deflibs with the OM3d.obj in your Blitzlibs:-directory.
The library-number of OM3d.obj is 7. If you have another library
with the same number, bad luck for you. (Just email me, perhaps
I will compile another number, or use a tool that can change
this number.)

And don`t forget to CD to the directory.

If you have really interests in that stuff email me for more
details.

The texture is made by a special tool by me. If you need it than email.

That`s all folks.

bye.
