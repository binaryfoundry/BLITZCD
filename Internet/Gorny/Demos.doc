2B3D CUBE DEMO

This is a standard cube spinning around. It shows how to get an object up
on the screen and make it do something.

All demos use the same controls for moving objects. Actually it's not the
objects that move around, but camera's viewpoint.

LEFT ARROW	- turn left
RIGHT ARROW	- turn right

UP ARROW	- go forward
DOWN ARROW	- move back

"Q"			- move upwards
"A"             - move down

'1'			- increase speed
'2'             - decrease speed


2B3D Demo 1

This little demo shows few 3d objects spinning around. Letter A is an example
of a one sided polygon. It will not be rendered if the polygon's back is
facing a viewer. It is useful with concave objects (like presented cube and
pyramid) where some of the polygons, ones facing away, can be removed.

Letter T is an example of an object made up of two sided polygons. polygons
will be rendered no matter which way they are facing.

Cube and a pyramid are both made up of one sided polygons. The scene uses
default light source created at 3d world initiation. Light source can be
changed using CreateLightSource(), but I found this setting to be most
effective visually.


2B3D DEMO 2

This is an attempt to create a 3d environment, with ability to walk around
a bit. The background bitmap I created in a rush, so it probably looks that
way. Nevertheless, it looks better than no bitmap at all in the background,
and it serves as an example how to manipulate bitmaps using TouchPalette()
function.

Now, if it only was synchrinized with 3d camera movement and scrolled
around a bit...
