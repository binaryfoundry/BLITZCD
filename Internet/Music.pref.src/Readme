 This is the Blitz source code for a simple preferences editor.  It was used
to allow the user to load and test music modules to be used with my games.  These
are then saved as a prefs file which the games will use to load & play the sel-
ected module with the game instead of the default module.  This would be helpful
to a beginning Blitz programmer to see how to go about this kind of thing.
 If you like the icons, you can find a whole set of Blitz icons on Aminet in
the pix/icon drawer (actually 2 sets, one for Magic Workbench and one for
NewIcons)

Later,

Curt
