Finished at last!

Sorry for the delays everyone, blame the usual people and me this time.


Things to note:

        - All the examples (except some of mine :) have runtime error
          checking on, so once you know the example compiles correctly,
          take runtime error checking off and recompile.

        - Some of the examples will not compile when running Blitz from
          floppy disk as they use commands in the large deflibs file. See
          below for a list of the examples and also how to create a new
          deflibs file.

        - If you are using Ted v1.1 don't forget to click the CD gadget on
          the Load File Requester as quite a few of the examples need to
          load additional data from the disk. With the new Ted v2.1 you do
          not need to change the directory anymore as it is done
          automatically when you load the example.


Things to be done for BUM10:

        - Get the Acid 3D library beta version from Simon (arghhh!!!)

        - Write plenty of examples for Acids Chunky/Chock library

        - Bug fixes to some of the Acidlibs

        - Bug fixes to NewTed (probably)

        - Add extra documentation to the on-line help  

        - Lots of other things!


People who deserve Thanks:

          who answer all the questions....

                             ==================
                             BUM9 Disk Contents
                             ==================


Blitz2
------

A direct replacement for the program disk that came with your original
Blitz2.1 package. The only changes with this release are a slightly larger
defaultdbug file and a bit more space on the disk. The reason for the
increase in space is so that floppy disk users can create a slightly
larger deflibs file containing the specific libraries they choose from
the blitzlibs disk (see the section below 'Creating a new Deflibs').



Blitzlibs
---------

This contains all the latest third party libraries and the new test
libraries. It also contains the resident files and two small Blitz
programs to allow you to create a new deflibs file and also view the
commands in any library.


amigalibs - Unchanged from BUM8/Full Blitz2.1 release. 

otherlibs - Same as BUM8, except ElmoreIncLib has been removed (it was a
            crippled version and Richard Elmore isn't supporting it now
            as far as I know), and XbonesCIAtrklib is now version 1.03

rilibs    - Several updated and new libraries from Reflective Images/LES, now
            in their own special directory.
  
testlibs  - One Acid Software test library (chunkylib) and two user
            libraries (XBaudiolib, GKdbaselib)

Please note that the large deflibs file (on BUM9examples2:HardDiskUsers/)
contains all these libraries in one big file and the small deflibs contains
only the amigalibs libraries.



BUM9examples1
-------------

Nigels_3D - A 3D tutorial/library written in Blitz (no assembly language)
            and gracefully donated by Dr. Nigel Hughes. 

TedsDemos - The best examples ever written in Blitz (more display library
            examples by me).
            
UserCode  - Lots of smaller examples mainly applications related, including
            several GadTools examples by Simon Archer.

UserGame  - Four small games all with documentation/source code.



BUM9examples2
-------------

DeflibMan     - A very nice utility written by Peter Eisenlohr. It allows
                you to create a new deflibs file from the libraries you
                select on the Blitzlibs disk. Source code not included.

Gorny_3D      - Another 3D tutorial/library written in Blitz by Maciej
                Gorny.

HardDiskUsers - Updated big debugger, NewTed (and ted.library) and big
                Deflibs. The files in this drawer directly replace the files
                in the blitz drawer on your Hard Drive.

HyperHelp     - Ralf Berkvens Multimedia-HyperText-BrowserType-Thing with
                full source code/extra libraries/etc.  



BUM9docs
--------

Docs_otherlibs    - These 3 directories contain the documentation for  
Docs_rilibs       - commands found in the libraries on the Blitzlibs  
Docs_testlibs     - disk.  

RI_Examples       - Example source code for the new commands found in the
                    Reflective Image libraries (Blitzlibs:rilibs/).

RI_FNS_Fonts      - FNS font editor program and lots of example fonts by
                    Reflective Images. 

Testlibs_Examples - Only one example in here for Graham Kenedy's dbaselib,
                    there should be some chunkylib examples on BUM10!  


                      
                          ======================
                          Creating A New Deflibs
                          ======================

Hard disk users can more or less ignore this section (and the next) as
the large deflibs file contains all the libraries on the Blitzlibs disk.

There are two ways to do this:

        1. Use the nice utility on BUM9examples2 disk called LibMan.

        2. Use the Blitz program MakeDefLibs.bb2, supplied on the
           Blitzlibs disk.


1. The preferred method
-----------------------

The LibMan utility is for WB2.0+ Amigas and you need to boot from your
Workbench disk as it needs to use the Amiga asl.library. Documents are
provided in the DefLibMan drawer but basically.....

     - Load Workbench

     - Insert BUM9examples2 and load the file LibMan 

     - After a bit of disk swapping you will have a list of all the
       libraries available in a scrollable window. 

     - Select the libraries you want to include and click on the
       create deflibs gadget	


2. The slightly tricky method
-----------------------------

If you are still using WB1.3, then you can try this....

     - Make a copy of your Blitzlibs disk

     - Delete all the libraries (.obj files) that you do not want to
       include. These are the files in the directories amigalibs,
       otherlibs, rilibs, testlibs

     - Load up Blitz and the MakeDeflibs program on the Blitzlibs disk

     - Compile and Run the program! 



                      ================================
                       Which libraries do I include ?
                      ================================

The following programs on the BUM9 examples disks use some of the commands
found in the third party libraries. If your deflibs file doesn't contain
these libraries when you try and compile the program, Blitz will report
the error 'Token Not Found' and the command will appear as ????? instead of
text.


  BUM9examples1:Nigel_3D/FUN_Editor.bb2                   
                                           
  BUM9examples1:UserCode/AGAfade256.bb2                   
                                              
  BUM9examples1:UserCode/AppWindow.bb2

  BUM9examples1:UserCode/Phonebase.bb2

  BUM9examples1:UserCode/WBDemo.bb2

  BUM9examples1:UserGame/BallBlitz.bb2

  BUM9examples2:HyperHelp/HHControl.bb2 and HyperHelp.bb2

  BUM9docs:RI_Examples/All the examples

  BUM9docs:Testlib_Examples/db_blitzbook.bb2


It seems these examples mainly use the Elmorelibs and NeilsReqtoolsLib, so
as a suggestion try making up a new deflibs containing:

    amigalibs/all of them
    otherlibs/all Elmorelibs, NeilsReqtoolsLib

The deflibs file created should be small enough to fit on your Blitz2
program disk.

Of course, if you want to try the RI_Examples you'll need to include
those libraries too...

While we're on the subject, could all you generous programmers who donate
your examples please include the names of any third-party libraries (if you
use any) at the top of your source code? Floppy disk users will then know
which library to include in their small deflibs file.



                           ================
                            Internet Users
                           ================

It has a very nice article on the WBStartup command and some other good
