          XBaudiolib (Temp lib #4) - Steve Flock (Xbones)
          -----------------------------------------------


This is a possible replacement for Acids' audio lib. It uses exactly the
same commands as the acid lib, except they are prefixed with the letters
XB.  

e.g.   Sound 0,15  becomes  XBSound 0,15

Steve believes his fixes have made significant speed increases to the acid
audio lib, so if there are no compatibility problems reported, this will 
be the new audio lib and the XB prefixes will be dropped.

If you have installed the large deflibs, you can try out the commands
using the Bum9examples1:UserCode/Set_Period.bb2 example. Just type XB in
front of the 'LoadSound' and the two 'Sound' commands and then recompile
the example.
