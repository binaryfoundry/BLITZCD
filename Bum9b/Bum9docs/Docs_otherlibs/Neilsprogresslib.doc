Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been several Progress Indicators around for a while.  Just about
all of them have problems of one form or another.  Some need 8 colour Work-
bench screens, none properly scale the incoming values.

A progress indicator should be adaptable to the programmers need, to
inform the user what is happening.  If creating a progress indicator is too
hard, then the programmer will give up, and the user will suffer.

Here is my solution to this.

This library consists on only three commands, and requires ReqTools to run.
The Progress Indicator is not part of ReqTools, but modeled closely on the
one in PowerPacker and the Amiga Style Guide.  The Indicator is usable in 
screens of 1 bitplane and up, and happily scales the data into a percentage 
bar.

For instance, suppose you are scanning through a block of memory on a byte
by byte basis, with start address Start and end address Start+4069.

To set up the requester, you'd type

  PICreateRequest("Please Wait...",Start,Start+4096)

and the requester takes care of every thing else.  To update the requester,
you'd type

  PIUpdateRequest(Start+Offset)

and the requester scales the addresses into a displayable form.


Commands
~~~~~~~~

ret.l=PICreateRequest(Title$,Min.l,Max.l [,NoGadgets])
------------------------------------------------------

Creates a Progress Indicator requester, locks the calling window and
returns either True or False.  Always check this!  The requester can fail
if there isn't enough memory, or Min>Max.

Min and Max refer to what the bar actually displays.  These are unsigned
values, so no negative numbers are allowed.

If the requester has returned True, then the window that called it is now
locked and will not accept any input from the user.  The only thing the
user can do now is hit the Cancel gadget.

If you include the NoGadgets field with any number at all, then the request
will open up WITHOUT a Stop gadget.  Use of this feature is stronHÁ j
