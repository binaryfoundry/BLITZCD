2.	Introduction

                               Introduction



The standard soundtracker replay routines supplied with Blitz Basic 2 have
many faults, which this library attempts to overcome.  Some of the features
are:

  - Plays all PT songs that utilise either the VBLANK timing or the
    more recent CIA based timings
  - Plays back correctly on 50/60Hz systems, running either PAL or NTSC
  - Contains more specialised functions for advanced programmers
  - Enables the programmer to syncronise graphics with their music


Credits:

Original ProTracker playroutine by Amiga Freelancers, converted and enhanced
for Blitz by Neil O'Rourke.  Naggings from Roy, Jeff and Richard. Newer
revisions and further enhancements by Crossbones/Binary Assault.


NOTE:

 Neil stopped work on the library at version 1.6. Unfortunately, all the
source code I've located of this library is only at version 1.3. This means
that if you are fimiliar with the last version of his library, a few of the
commands might not contain the same sytax or might not even be in this library
any more.

 If you find that you simply can't live without a certain feature, you might
try to contact me and coax me into providing the update you need.  I say
*MIGHT* because there is no guarentee that I'll work on it.

3.	Getting Started/Installation

                             Getting Started:


What you'll need:

 o Blitz Basic II version 1.8 or greater.

                                  - Page 2 -
3.	Getting Started/Installation

 o An Amiga*
 o Any music file in protracker format.


Machine Requirements:

 o Kickstart 2.0x+
 o At least 1 meg of chip ram.
 o A kickin' stereo.

Note: You might be able to get away with using less memory (i.e. 512k) but I
      wouldn't recommend it, and I'm not. :)

Installing the library:

 First, remove any older version of this library you might have. Look for
names such as "NeilsTrackerLib.obj" or "CiaTrackerLib.obj." Don't delete them,
but move them out of the way for now, keeping them until you're sure you don't
need them, or that you've found the correct library to remove.

 Now copy the included library into your blitzlibs:userlibs directory. Once
copied, you'll need to recompile your DEFLIBS file to use it. (NOTE: Users of
version 2.1 need not do this, according to Acid.)

* - I sincerely hope you have one of these. :)

4.	Commands (Contents)

                                 Commands

                              CheckTrackerID   
                               ModuleToChip    
                              GetModuleName$   
                            ModulePositionJump 
                             GetModulePosition 
                                PauseModule    
                            ChangeTrackerVBLank
                                PlayTracker    
                               TrackerVolume   
                             ChangeTrackerMask 
                               ModulePatterns  
                             ModuleSampleName  

5.	LoadTrackerModule (Command)

                             LoadTrackerModule

Usage:

success=LoadTrackerModule(TrackerModule#,FileName$)

Comments:

Loads the named module into chip ram, ready for playing.  This command can
only be called in Amiga mode.  success is a boolean return code (true).  If
the load fails for any reason, success returns the AmigaDOS error code.


                                  - Page 3 -
5.	LoadTrackerModule (Command)

Note that there is an implicit call to FreeTrackerModule for whatever module
you are trying to load.  However, if you want to load another module, don't
try to load it on top of the existing one that is playing. Use another
TrackerModule# (you have from 0 to 8).  The results are unpredictable, and
range from nothing to a system crash.  We can't call StopTracker, because this
will stop everything.

6.	StartTracker (Command)

                               StartTracker

Usage:

success=StartTracker(TrackerModule#)

Comments:

Starts to play the requested module, stopping any modules already playing, or
restarts the current module, and returns true.  Returns false if the module
couldn't be started for some reason (like it isn't loaded).

7.	StopTracker (Command)

                                StopTracker

Usage:

StopTracker

Comments:

Stops the current module. Not much to it, really.

8.	DecodeModule (Command)

                               DecodeModule

Usage:

DecodeModule TrackerModule#,ModuleAddress

Comments:

 This sets an arbitary area of memory as a tracker module, useful if you have
BLoaded/INCBIN'd a file and want to hear if it is a module. Caution:  a
non-module may crash the Amiga when you try to play it.

NOTE: As of release 1.02a, the ModuleToChip command has been changed.
      DecodeModule now does this for you automatically if the module that
      is being decoded is in fast ram. The ModuleToChip command will still
      tokenise though, to prevent problems that might occur to previous
      users of this library.

9.	GetTrackerSize (Command)

                              GetTrackerSize

Usage:

trackerlength=GetTrackerSize(TrackerModule#)  

Comments:

Not really much of a useful command. Simply returns the size (in bytes) that
the module is using in memory. There should be no need to use this
information,  and these commands are only included because they served a
purpose in debugging  a long time ago, and to remove them would cause problems

                                  - Page 4 -
9.	GetTrackerSize (Command)

with the Blitz tokens.

10.	GetTrackerLocation (Command)

                              GetTrackerLocation

Usage:

trackerlength=GetTrackerLocation(TrackerModule#)  

Comments:

Not really much of a useful command. Simply returns the memory location that
the module is occupying. There should be no need to use this information,  and
these commands are only included because they served a purpose in debugging  a
long time ago, and to remove them would cause problems with the Blitz tokens.

11.	FreeTrackerModule (Command)

                             FreeTrackerModule

Usage:

FreeTrackerModule TrackerModule#

Comments:

This frees a module loaded with LoadTrackerModule.  You cannot free a module
that has been set up with DecodeModule (see below), but there is nothing to
stop you trying.

12.	GetTrackerEvent (Command)

                              GetTrackerEvent

Usage:

trackerevent=GetTrackerEvent

Comments:

This command is a customised extension to the ProTracker replay routine.  A
"TrackerEvent" occurs when the replay routine comes across a $8xx command.
This command is not defined in the command list, and many demos (eg Jesus on
E's) use it to trigger effects.  This command gets the most recent
TrackerEvent, so any program looking at this will have to compare the current
value to the value that triggered the current effect.

13.	CheckTrackerEvent (Command)

                             CheckTrackerEvent

Usage:

success=CheckTrackerEvent

Comments:

This routine checks to see if a TrackerEvent has occured since the last time
the routine was called, and returns True if it has.  Use GetTrackerEvent to
determine what data the $8xx command had.

14.	WaitTrackerEvent (Command)

                             WaitTrackerEvent

Usage:

                                  - Page 5 -
14.	WaitTrackerEvent (Command)


event=WaitTrackerEvent

Comments:

 Someone mentioned this command works.. I haven't checked it, so use at your
own risk.

 Refer to CheckTrackerEvent/GetTrackerEvent for more information about this
command.

15.	CheckTrackerID (Command)

                               CheckTrackerID

Usage:

success=CheckTrackerID(TrackerModule#)

Comments:

This checks the module for the standard Pro/Noise/SoundTracker ID string
"M.K." (or "M!K!" in the case of a 100 pattern PT module), and returns True if
one of them is found.  This means that you can safely call StartTracker.

Note that there is no 100% guarenteed way of determining what is a module and
what isn't.  Bit Arts, for example, remove the M.K. identifier to make it
harder to rip modules, so if you're writing a module ripping program, you have
to take this result with a grain of salt.

16.	ModuleToChip (Command)

                               ModuleToChip



NOTE: This command is outdated as of this release. Even though the command
      will tokenise, the command has no function. Please see the
      DecodeModule command for more details.

      Matter of fact, attempt to use this command will throw the debugger up
      in arms. (This is to get people to remove this command from their
      code.)

17.	GetModuleName$ (Command)

                              GetModuleName$

Usage:

name$=GetModuleName$(TrackerModule#)

Comments:

Returns the name of the module in name$. Not too useful, but I made a little
interface for workbench using the library, and needed a command like this.

18.	ModulePositionJump (Command)

                            ModulePositionJump

Usage:

ModulePositionJump(Position#)

Comments:


                                  - Page 6 -
18.	ModulePositionJump (Command)

 This command tells the play routine to jump to the pattern requested in
Position#.

NOTE: There is no error checking done at this time. It would be wise to know
      where you're going.

19.	GetModulePosition (Command)

                             GetModulePosition

Usage:

position=GetModulePosition

Comments:

This returns the current pattern the replay routine is playing.

20.	PauseModule (Command)

                                PauseModule

Usage:

PauseModule

Comments:

Stops the current module from playing, effectively pausing it. Use the command
again to unpause it.

21.	ChangeTrackerVBlank

                            ChangeTrackerVBlank

Usage:

ChangeTrackerVBlank

Comments:

This command seems pretty useless, but there sure are alot of module players
that offer vblank timing. Call the command before playing the module, then
call the StartTracker command, so it knows which module to use. Then simply
call the PlayModule command on every vblank.

22.	PlayModule (Command)

                                PlayModule

Usage:

PlayModule

Comments:

 This command is to be used if you use the ChangeTrackerVBlank command.

 To use this command, call ChangeTrackerVBlank first. Secondly, call the
StartTracker command. At each vblank, you must then call PlayMoudule, which
will keep the music playing.

23.	TrackerVolume (Command)

                               TrackerVolume

Usage:

                                  - Page 7 -
23.	TrackerVolume (Command)


TrackerVolume [Volume Level]

Comments:

 What can be said? This command changes the volume level of the module. Note:
this effects all the channels currently masked in. (Refer to the command
ChangeTrackerMask for more information on this).

24.	ChangeTrackerMask

                             ChangeTrackerMask

Usage:

ChangeTrackerMask [NewMask]

Comments:

 For all intents and purposes, you might never need this command. This command
allows you to tell the replay routine that it is not supposed to use a certain
channel, or certain channels. This is useful if you want, for instance, a two
channel module playing and sounds effects at the same time. The command wants
to know what channels the replay routine CAN use.

How to figure out what channels to mask:

 This is fairly simple, and there are a couple of different ways to do this.

 1. ChangeTrackerMask %0000ABCD - Where ABCD represents channels 0-3.

    Channels to be used by the replay routine would be represented as
    1's, and channels you wish to use for sound effects, etc., would be
    represented as 0's.

    Example: ChangeTrackerMask %00001001 would play channels 0 and 3, while
    channels 1 and 2 would be free for you to use.

 2. ChangeTrackerMask [DecimalValue] - Where decimal value represents:

    1 - Channel 0
    2 - Channel 1
    4 - Channel 2
    8 - Channel 3

    Example: ChangeTrackerMask 9 would play channels 0 and 3, while channels
    1 and 2 would be free for you to use.

25.	ModulePositions

                              ModulePatterns

Usage:

patt=ModulePatterns(Module#)

Comments:

 This command is kind of useless, but I wanted one so it's included. ;) All
this command does is return the number of patterns used in the module.

26.	Command - ModuleSampleName

                             ModuleSampleName

Usage:


                                  - Page 8 -
26.	Command - ModuleSampleName

a$=ModuleSampleName(Module#,Sample#)

Comments:

 This command is kind of useless, but I wanted one so it's included. ;) All
this command does is return the sample name. Sample names are numbered 0-30.

Things I know about

 o Because of some unknown problem, the routine actually reserves 3 bytes of
   memory (added to the actual module size.) Keep this in mind when calling
   the function to find out the byte-size of a module.

Things I don't know about

 Well!?! If I don't know about them, I can't really put them here can I? ;)

29.	History

                   Revision History : CiaTrackerLibrary

Pre 1.01B:

 -Original version by Neil updated to use a decent method of CIA timing. No
  longer needs the crappy "SetDMA" command. :)

1.01B:

 -Fixed problem with slots. (Was supposed to be able to allow 0-8, but was
  only set only to keep track through 7.
 -Added various commands in an attempt to get up to date with the commands
  from Neil's last update. (Version 1.6)
 -Added better run-time error checking (Limited edition version of 1.01B.)

1.02:

 -Hoo boy! Did I ever screw up 1.01B. Good thing I didn't send it too much.
  Seems that the run-time errors section REALLY made a mess of things.
  Deleted them and rewrote the entire error checking system. MUCH better.
 -I am now using the TrackerTester program on all versions of the library

                                  - Page 9 -
29.	History

  ready for release. Since I have problems with beta testers offering to
  help, then never saying a damn thing once they get the library, I figure
  this is the next best thing. Checks all major commands for failure.
  (NOTE: This program is now included in releases. Use it if you have
  problems and report the errors/bugs to me for fixing.)
 -Fixed small problem with LoadTrackerModule command. (1.02a)
 -DecodeModule command changed to also include function from ModuleToChip.
  ModuleToChip still tokenises, but performs no function. (1.02a)
 -Repaired section that grabs the cia timer. This fixed the following
  problems:
  - Used to lose characters over the serial port when the player was active.
  - Failed to play if one of the two cia timers was being used. (It only
    was able to allocate one timer successfully, and failed on the other.)
  These two should fix any problems the player had on specific machines.
  (1.02a)

1.03 (Current):

 - Routine failed completely on 68000 machines. Was accessing bytes/words
   at odd addresses.
 - Improved the decoding section and the init section.
 - Improved the loader code. The routine will no longer try to use traps
   when the debugger is disabled. Also added a file-check to the run time
   errors section.
 - It is now possible to find out which version of the lib you have by
   doing a version on the lib itself. (Versions prior to 1.3 won't have
   version information.)
