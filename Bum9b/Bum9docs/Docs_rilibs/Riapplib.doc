Introduction
============

This small library provides quick and easy to use commands for accessing
AppWindows, AppIcons and AppMenus.

An AppWindow is a window on the Workbench screen which will allow you
to drag file(s) from into it, instead of ploughing through file-requesters.

An AppMenu adds a menu item to the "Tools" menu of the Workbench. It is
normally used for when the program is 'sleeping' and the user wishes to
wake it up. In addition, if any files are selected and the menu item
is selected these are passed to the program.

An AppIcon is just like a normal file icon on the Workbench except it
allows you to drop file(s) onto it, or to double-click it to wake
up the program.

These features require at Workbench v2.0 or higher.



Function : AppEvent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : status=AppEvent

This command checks to see whether or not an 'App'Event (e.g. File
dropped onto an AppIcon or Menu Item selected) has occurred.

This function will return 0 if no event has occurred, else
$80000 if :
	An AppMenu was selected
        An AppIcon was double-clicked
        A File Was Dragged Into An AppWindow
        A File Was Dragged Onto An AppIcon

********
* NOTE * : This function no longer returns the number of files
********   selected. $80000 is returned instead of -1.
           See AppNumFiles().

e.g.

  Repeat
    VWait
    appev.l=AppEvent		; Has something happened
  Until appev
  If appev=$80000
    NPrint "An AppEvent Occurred! !"
  EndIf


Function : AddAppWindow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=AddAppWindow(windownumber)

This command attempts to make the window specified by 'windownumber' to become
an AppWindow. -1 means success, 0 means failure. There is a limit of 16
AppWindows open at any one time.


Function : AddAppIcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=AddAppIcon(id,text$,iconname$)

This command attempts to place an AppIcon onto the Workbench desktop.
ID is a unique identification number. Text$ is text to display underneath
the AppIcon and Iconname$ is the name of the file to use the Icon imagery.
-1 means success, 0 means failure. There is a limit of 16 AppIcons.
e.g.

  suc=AddAppIcon(0,"QuickFormat","SYS:System/Format")
  If suc=0 Then End
  

Function : AddAppMenu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=AddAppMenu(id,text$)

This command tries to add 'text$' to the Tools menu of Workbench.
ID is a unique identification number. Returns -1 for success, 0 for failure.
There is a limit of 16 AppMenu items.

e.g.

  suc=AddAppMenu(0,"Wakey Wakey")
  If suc=0 Then End


Function : AppEventCode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : apptype=AppEventCode

This function will return the type of App object which caused the event.
0=No Event Occurred
1=AppWindow
2=AppIcon
3=AppMenu

e.g.

  Repeat
    VWait
    appev.l=AppEvent		; Has something happened
  Until appev
  Select AppEventCode
    Case 1
      NPrint "An AppWindow caused this!"
    Case 2
      NPrint "An AppIcon caused this!"
    Case 3
      NPrint "An AppMenu caused this!"
  End Select


Function : AppEventID
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : idnumber=AppEventID

  This will return the object ID number which caused the AppEvent.
  This ID number refers to the one which was used in 
  AddAppIcon/AddAppWindow/AddAppWindow.

  -1 means that no AppEvent occurred.


Function : NextAppFile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : filename$=NextAppFile

  This will return the full path and filename for the file/drawer/volume
  which was selected when an AppEvent occurred.  If a directory was selected
  then a '/' is appended to file name. If a volume (e.g. a Disk) was
  selected then a ":" is appended.

  An empty string means nothing was selected.

  e.g.
  ; AppStuff initalized
  Repeat
    VWait
    appev.l=AppEvent
  Until appev=$80000      ; repeat until some files are selected.
  numfiles.l=AppNumFiles
  For n=1 To numfiles
    NPrint "File number "+str$(n)+" is "+NextAppFile
  Next n


Function : AppNumFiles
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : numfiles=AppNumFiles

  This will return the number of files selected when the AppEvent occurred.
  

Function : AppFile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : filename$=AppFile(file#)

  This will return the full path and filename for the file/drawer/volume
  which was selected when an AppEvent occurred. The file# parameter
  specifies which file to return. If a directory was selected then a '/'
  is appended to file name. If a volume (e.g. a Disk) was selected then
  a ":" is appended.

  An empty string means nothing was selected.

  e.g.
  ; AppStuff initalized
  Repeat
    VWait
    appev.l=AppEvent
  Until appev=$80000      ; repeat until some files are selected.
  numfiles.l=AppNumFiles
  For n=1 To numfiles
    NPrint "File number "+str$(n)+" is "+AppFile(n)
  Next n


Function: DelAppWindow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=DelAppWindow[(number)]

These commands will remove the AppWindow from the system and free up the
associated message port.


Function: DelAppIcon
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=DelAppIcon[(id)]

These commands will remove the AppIcon from the system and free up the
associated message port.


Function: DelAppMenu
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=DelAppMenu[(id)]

These commands will remove the AppMenu from the system and free up the
associated message port.
