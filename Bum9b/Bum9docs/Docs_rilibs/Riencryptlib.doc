Introduction
============

This little library provides some commands for easy, yet hard to crack
encryption.



Statement: Encrypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes : Amiga/Blitz
Syntax: Encrypt memadr,len[,wheel1,wheel2,wheel3]

  This will encrypt a block of memory starting at the address and running
through to addresslength-1.  The optional wheel parameters allow you to 
specify the start positions of the three wheels.  If you leave these out
then the wheels' start positions will be randomised.


Function: GetWheel
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes : Amiga/Blitz
Syntax: value=GetWheel(n)

  This will tell you the position that wheel n stopped at after encrypting
a file.  n can range from 1 to 3 - YOU MUST REMEMBER THESE POSITIONS IF
YOU WANT TO DECRYPT THE FILE (at the moment at least).


Statement: Decrypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes : Amiga/Blitz
Syntax: Decrypt memadr,len,wheel1,wheel2,wheel3

    Same Encrypt except that it does the opposite and the wheel positions
ARE NOT OPTIONAL.  The positions should be the ones you wrote down after
encrypting the file.
