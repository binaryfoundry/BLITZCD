Introduction
============
Low-ish-level library for trackloaders and the like. For example,
you can hide information on a disk track..not very useful nowadays,
but you never know...



Statement/Function : OpenDisk
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=OpenDisk(unit#)

This attempts to open unit 'unit#' of the trackdisk.device, for use with
the other Statement/Functions in this library. A return value of 0 indicates failure,
-1 indicates success.


Statement : MotorOn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : MotorOn unit#

This attempts to switch the drive motor on of the previously opened
trackdisk unit (called with OpenDisk). You must call this Statement/Function
before attempting to ReadSector/WriteSector/FormatTrack/WriteBoot


Statement : MotorOff
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : MotorOff unit#

This turns the drive motor of 'unit#' off.


Statement/Function : ReadSector
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : [success=]ReadSector(unit#,sector#,buffer[,numsectors])

This attempts to read 'numsectors' sectors from a trackdisk device which
has been opened with OpenDisk and has its Motor On. If numsectors is
omitted then 1 sector is read. The data is read into the memory location
pointed to by 'buffer'.

WARNING! Please MAKE SURE the MOTOR is _ON_ otherwise, all hell will break
loose!!!


Statement/Function : WriteSector
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : [success=]WriteSector(unit#,sector#,buffer[,numsectors])

This is the same as ReadSector except........... it writes!
(and no, I am not being lazy by not typing any decent docs)


Statement/Function : FormatTrack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : [success=]FormatTrack(unit#,track#,buffer[,numtracks])

This does a TD_FORMAT on the specified track number. Buffer should point
to the area of memory which the track should be formatted with. I don't
know why this Statement/Function exists - but hey, it might come in useful.


Statement/Function : WriteBoot
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : [success=]WriteBoot(unit#[,buffer])

This writes 1k of data to the bootblock of the specified disk unit.
The optional buffer parameter should point to an area of memory with which
to write the bootblock.


Statement : CloseDisk
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : CloseDisk unit#

This closes the trackdisk.device of the specified unit#. The Motor is
automatically switched off if it is already on.
