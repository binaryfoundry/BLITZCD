FNS Editor v0.1
===============


This is just a VERY quick doc for this brilliant program (ego-trip time!).


Usage: Double click from Workbench

	or

       Run from CLI

If running from the CLI you can give a parameter specifying a EXISTING font
to edit (give name and full path).

Basically, this prog allows you create/edit/save my FNS font files.  In
addition, it allows you to grab Amiga fonts as FNS fonts.  It uses
Intuition throughout so you shouldn't have any problems getting to grips
with how it looks.

Main Window
-=-=-=-=-=-

  From here you can load/save fonts and do global adjustments to the font
currently being edited.  You can have upto 8 FNS fonts loaded at any one
time, the currently active font is named in the window and is shown in the
example text window.  Use the menus to change fonts if you have more than
one loaded.
  Clicking on the EDIT gadget or select EDIT from the menu EDIT will take
you to the font edit window.

Font Edit Window
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This is where you can actually edit (or draw if you're feeling brave)
your font.  The window is split up into two parts: on the left is the zoom
area which gives you an enlarged view of the current character and on the
right is the action window which gives you some gadgets to play with.

  All the gadgets should be fairly easy to understand, I should say, though,
that the width is used when printing the character and should be set so
that there is a blank gap on the right of the current character.  Confused?
Well just click on Auto_W (auto width) which will calculate exactly how
wide the character should be automatically.  Note: at the moment the SWAP
gadget does bugger all - nevermind.......

  To draw, just move into the boxed area inside the zoom area and press a
button.  Left mouse button draws whilst right mouse button deletes (sorry -
no colour fonts are supported yet, maybe soon if there's demand.....).  Four
basic drawing modes are available: freehand, line, box and bar; select each
by clicking on its icon in the botton right hand corner of the edit window.

  Change characters by: using the scroll bar, clicking on the '---->' or
'<----" gadgets or pressing the key you want to edit on the keyboard.


  That's all I can be bothered to write as my eyes are going all funny from
sitting in front of this computer for too long.
  If you like this program and want to use it but can't figure out how the
f*** it works them please mail me and I'll try to come up with some better
instructions for it than this rubbish.
