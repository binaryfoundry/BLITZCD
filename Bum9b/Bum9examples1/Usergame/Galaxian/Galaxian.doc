Simon,

Well here is my entry for the competition, I would of done more on it but I
only got the competition notice 2 days ago.  SO since then I have been hacking
out reams of code for the competition.  Well it is just a simpel shootem up at
this stage, I had no time to put bullets on to the aliens but as you will 
discover, they don't need any for now and it gives enough scope for anyone to
pik up the code and have some fun!  

Thanks 

Andrew
