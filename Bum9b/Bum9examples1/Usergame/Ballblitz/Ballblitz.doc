PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nothing to it really:
Use the joystick to rotate the wheel at the bottom of the screen.
Press fire to launch the ball up the screen. If it lands next
to three or more balls of the same colour, then they are all
blitzed! When there are no more balls left, you are moved to the
next level.


HINTS
~~~~~

Any balls that aren't attached to the top of the screen will fall
down after each shot. Try and learn to take advantage of this -
take a little more time to plan a shot, and it is sometimes possible
to remove nearly all the balls at once!
