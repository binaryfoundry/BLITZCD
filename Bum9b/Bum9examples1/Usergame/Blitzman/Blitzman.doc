  Well since no one reads doc files (I hardly ever do..) and I'm fast running
out of time to write this, I'll keep it short.

  Blitz Man is a PacMan derivitive, you eat little yellow pills until you
clear a level.  If you eat a purple pill, for a short time you can eat the
monsters that are trying to eat you, errrm and thats about it really......
What makes this game better than the orginal PacMan?  Not a lot. If anything.
  Well I had plans, but unsurprisingly, due to the compitition deadline have
been unable to use them (this has been a six day effort, start to finish), so
if you want to add something feel free to add it yourself or give me a call.

  Three good points for this game:
    1 - Two players at once.  But be careful players can't cross so you and
        your friend can be caught between monsters with no where to go.
    2 - Map editor.  You can design and play on your own levels.  At the
        moment there are ownly 10 levels, but you can increase the number by
        increase int #Levels constant in the source code. *You will loses
        old levels however*
    3 - You've got the source code. ;)


The Game:

  You can select one or two players, and fast or slow speed at the beginning
of the game.  The speed settings control the speed of both the players and the
monsters, and so can alter the difficulty of the game.
  We you eat a purple pill your character will begin to flash, this will last
for about 3 seconds and during this time you can safely eat the monsters.
Once killed monsters will disappear for about 3 seconds and then reappear
at random on the map.  When they appear they will flash for a second, during
this time they cannot kill you.
  Scoring points:
    Yellow pills - 1 point.
    Purple pills - 5 points.
    Eating Monsters - 25 points.



The Editor:

  The keys that are used in the editor are shown at the bottom of the screen
at all times.
  They are:
    m - change editor mode.
    l - cycle through levels.
    s - save all levels.
    c - clear current level.
    f - fill all blank places with yellow pills.
    p - display movement path on the map. (Until map is changed.)
    Esc - Exit to main menu.

  There are 5 modes of operation, depending on what you want to place on the
level.  In each mode the mouse buttons place different things on the map.
    Wall mode:    left mouse button places wall pieces.
                  RMB removes piece. (place Grass)
    Small pills:  LMB place yellow pill.
                  RMB remove piece.
    Big pills:    LMB place purple pill.
                  RMB remove piece.
    Tunnels:      LMB make tunnel.
                  RMB fill in tunnel.
    Start Pos:    LMB player one's starting position.
                  RMB player two's starting position.
                  Note: you may only place starting positions on blank
                  (grass) places.


That's about it really.

If you want to use, alter, or use bits of the program or gfx fill free
to do so. The code is at least paritialy commented (depending on how much
time I have left =(  )  But hopefully someone can find something usefull
in there.  If anyone wants fully documented code then just let me know
and I'll email it to you.
