Now then, what is WBSnake?
--------------------------

WBSnake is a quite traditional 'snake' game made using Blitz
Basic 2. It has, however, some features that hopefully
separates it from some of the competition:


    * As the name suggests, it runs in a Workbench window.

    * The window and the graphics are fully rescaleable.

    * WBSnake is automatically paused when its window is
      deactivated. Very nice if another window suddenly
      pops up stopping keyboard input to the WBSnake
      window. This would normally lead to the snake
      crashing into the nearest wall.

    * Demands fairly little processor time.

    * Should (I'm afraid I haven't tried) work on any
      Amiga, with any version of Workbench.



So, that's all?
---------------

Yes...

WBSnake was thrown together (oh, I just love clichés :-) )
in a couple of days, and is definitely not the world's most
original game. It does, however, what it's supposed to do
(in my view), namely being a small and nice Workbench game
suitable for playing if you've nothing more sensible to do.

Please feel free to give me feedback on the game. Maybe I
should make a collection of resizeable WB-games. Or maybe
you think this WBSnake is so bad I should avoid programming
any more...
