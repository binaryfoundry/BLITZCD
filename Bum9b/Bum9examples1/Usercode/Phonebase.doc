              PhoneBase V1.0 (C) Anthony Brice 1996
              -------------------------------------

PhoneBase is a quick and simple gui name and address database written to
learn the use of newtype routines and using them within Blitz. A freebie
program for anyone who finds a use for it as it's not intended to be a
really powerfull application, and these kind of programs are ten a penny.

Use of this program is pretty much self-explanatory, but for the first time
users of this kind of program, I'll document some important parts.

There are 3 string gadgets on the main gui. The first one is for entering the
name of the person who's data you're entering, the second is the address (with
PhoneBase the strings are not restricted in any way so you could use an
email address here if you prefered) and the bottom one is for putting in
their phone number or any other data you wish.

Add  - will move up to the first string gadget so you can enter data for a new
       record.

Del  - will delete current record and shuffle accordingly.

?    - obligatory about requestor

Next - Moves to next record if it exists

Prev - Moves to previous record

Find - Let's you enter a text string to hunt the database for. At the moment
       it just uses the name field, but that can easilly be expanded upon.

Load - Load in the current data file. This is done automatically when the
       program is first run anyway.

       PhoneBase is no longer stupid enough to load just any file in :-)

Save - Saves the current data. File path is S:PhoneBase.dat - Note that the
       program will rename the old data file to PhoneBase.dat.bak as a 
       precaution in case you make an error. It will only store one save
       file as a backup so please be carefull clicking the save gadget too
       many times.

Jump - Will prompt for a number string and jump to that record if it exists.

F    - Will move to the first record in the list.

L    - Will move to the last record in the list.

Sort - Will perform an alphabetical order sorting of the records file based
       on the name string for each entry.


That's about it. This program is freeware, and source code (Blitz 2) is
included in the archive for those interested. I'd appreciate a thank you if
you find any of the code, or this program usefull, and nobody is allowed to
charge for this program apart from PD libraries which can cover their costs
if they wish to distribute it.

Acid have full permission to include this program and source on a future 
issue of the BlitzUserMagazines if they are so inclined.

I may well make a more configurable database type program with many more
powerfull features in the future should I be pestered enough. But this was
developed strictly as a backdrop to testing certain functions within blitz as
a development language, so I purposely kept it pretty simple.

Thanks :- Paul Juhasz, Simon Archer and Paul Lathwell for inspiration.
