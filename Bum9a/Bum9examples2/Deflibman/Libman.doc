LibMan is a utility to help all BlitzBasic2 users creating their deflibs
files. BlitzBasic2 is (c) by Acid Software.


Getting started...
------------------

Just click on its icon. LibMan will automatically try to load Blitzlibs:
and blitz2:acidlibs, if it doesn't find them, you can specify the path in
the Preferences menu and try to load the libs again with 'Read Libs' from
the Project Menu. You can save these setiings in ENVARC: by selecting
'Save settings' from the Project Menu.


What's this?!
-------------

What you can see now is a window with a list of all libs LibMan found in
BlitzLibs: and some gadgets at the bottom of the window.

The number shown after a lib is its libnum. Clashes (i.e. double libnums)
are shown in white color.

If 'ACID' appears as a libnum, the library is already included in the
acidlibs file.

You can select in which order LibMan sorts the libs, by NAME or by LibNum,
as you prefer.

What's it for?
--------------

Let's come to the main use of this program:  You can easily create deflibs
files by selecting libs you want to have in this file (or which you don't
want to have in this file, of course, see clashes).

Just select the libs you want to include in the deflibs and click on 'Make
Deflibs'.  LibMan will create a _new_ deflibs file (located in the drawer
you specified in the Preferences menu, default is Blitzlibs:deflibs).

If you want to select ALL libs, just click on 'All', to deselect all libs
click on 'Clear'.

With the 'Auto' function LibMan will include all libs, but automatically
exclude all libs with double numbers or an 'ACID' libnum.



That's it, now enjoy!
