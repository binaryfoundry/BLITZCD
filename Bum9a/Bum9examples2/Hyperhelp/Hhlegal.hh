[c][b]Conditions for spreading HyperHelp v2.0[b][c][h][t Spreading Conditions]
HyperHelp 2 is a freeware product. This means you can spread it to anyone you
like. You can not ask any money for the product itself, only for the medium you
are spreading it on. This also goes for PD shops.[p]
I want everybody to be able to enjoy this product, so I have decided to offer
some support. If you find a bug that I can fix, I will send you the newer
version, but only if you have Internet so that I can E-Mail it to you. My own
E-mail address is : [b]ralf@stack.urc.tue.nl[b]. Feel free to mail any comments
and suggestions.
