[c][b]HyperHelp General History[b][h][t History][c]
HyperHelp began in 1995 as a project to create something better than
AmigaGuide. HyperHelp 1 was released somewhere in 1995, and boasted such
options as converting from AmigaGuideDocs, and converting to HTML code. It was
an okay program, with just too many rules to it. The code itself was horrible
too, so it was decided to create a whole new version.[p]
So from April 27th to 30th 1996 HyperHelp 2 was created,this time not as a
replacement for AmigaGuide, but as an easy-to-use Help-document writer for the
Fortunates and anyone else wishing to use it. It was completely recoded, using
better routines, and using a lot less memory.

[b]HyperHelp 1, release version[b][p]
The HyperHelp 1 release version was the first attempt at a hyperlink browser,
and was based around HTML type tags. It could 'almost' convert AmigaGuide
documents to it's own format, and could convert to HTML too. It had
error-checking facilities, and generally the user had to keep a lot of rules in
mind.[e]
The interface was good, although a bit crowded, and the Window was only half a
workbench screen wide. It suppported inline IFFs, but the length of any document
was limited to 512 lines (4096 pixels). The way it rendered documents made it
very memory-hungry.[p]
[b]HyperHelp 2.0 version 1.2b[b][p]
This was the base for the new HyperHelp program. The code was much more
intelligent, making memory use nothing to worry about. This version had only one
font, with 3 styles, could display IFF's, and play Protracker, SID, Player6.1
and 8SVX sounds. Linking between docs was still supported, but a linkd within
docd were disposed of. Tags changed from version 1, making them easier for the
user.[p]
[b]HyperHelp 2.0 version 1.4b[b][p]
This newer version of HyperHelp 2 adds a lot more to the concept. The program
now takes any Intuition font, wether proportional or not, at any size. Further
more, yo ucan now select which SID song to play, and IFF's are remapped if you
have EXEC 39+. Links can now be safely centered too.[p]
[b]HyperHelp 2.0 v1.4b1.003[b][p]
After a few updates this version emerged. New features are : works on any
EXEC,and remaps on all too. Also, an AppIcon is shown when iconified.[p]
[b]HyperHelp 2.0 v1.5b (This Version)[b][p]
Another few updates and bugfixes, and this version came to life. A new feature
is a message-port whereby external programs can control HyperHelp 2.0. There is
an example controller included in the archive. It is called 'hh2control'.[p]
