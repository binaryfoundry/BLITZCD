Okay, so what does HyperHelp2 actually do?
[e]Well, it is a document viewer, which takes HyperHelp 2 type documents as its
input. Let me sum up some of the features.[p]
* Can display documents of up to 4096 pages (=4 MB)[e]
* Can display 255 links per page[e]
* Uses Hyperlinks to access other documents/objects[e]
* Can display pictures[e]
* Can play sounds[e]
* Easy to use button bar[e]
* Will play a module while you read[e]
* Knows several font styles[e]
* Will use any Intuition type Font[e]
* Auto indents paragraphs[p]
Okay, now that you know something about the program, let me explain some things
in more detail.[p]
HyperHelp 2 documents are based around text. Just plain black text. If, however,
one would wish to refer to another document, one could establish a HyperLink
between the two documents. This results in some blue text, on which the reader
can click to be immedeately transported to the other document.[p]
But there is more. Many types of object can hide beneath a blue piece of text
too! You can, for example, include images, which will come up in their own window, and sounds,
which will play when the blue words are clicked.[p]
That is generally what HyperHelp 2 is about. You will find that most
documentation of our own tools is done in this format, as it is very easy to
use.[p]
There is just one more feature I wish to mention. You can call up HyperHelp 2
with one parameter. That will then be the Index File, and will be displayed when
the program finishes loading.[p][l hhhelp.hh|doc]Back to the index[l]
