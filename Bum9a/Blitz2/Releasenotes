                      ====================
                       BUM9 Release Notes
                      ====================

     -=* Additional documentation is on the BUM9docs disk *=-



----------------------------
New things for this release:
----------------------------

- New small debugger 

- New big debugger                   (WB2.0+ amigas only)

- New Teditor version 2.1            (WB2.0+ amigas only)

- Acid Software Chunky library beta release        

- Reflective Image libraries version 4.5  

- Graham Kennedy Database library version 1.06 beta

- Steve Flock CIA (pro)tracker library version 1.03

- Steve Flock audio library beta release



---------------------------------------------------------
Bugs that have hopefully been squashed with this release:
---------------------------------------------------------

- Crashes when using Functions and Statements (due to the small debugger
  not liking the new debug library - this bug would not have affected
  advanced (large) debugger users)

- NewTed's blank menu problems with Workbench 2.0/2.1

- NewTed's problems when running the program MCP

- Other not so obvious or nasty bugs with NewTed/BigDebugger!



-----------------
Floppy Disk Users
-----------------

This disk is a direct replacement for your Blitz2.1 program disk.

Please note that you will not be able to compile some of the examples
on the examples disks because they use additional commands contained
in the large deflibs file. Blitz will report the error 'Token Not
Found' and the command will appear as ????? instead of text. A 
utility has been provided with this release, that will allow you to
make a new deflibs file containing only the third party libraries you
require (see Readme file on BUM9 docs disk).



---------------
Hard Disk Users
--------------- 

You will find the upgraded Blitz program files on the BUM9examples2
disk in a directory called HardDiskUsers. 

  defaultdbug  (154K) \    These 3 files are direct replacements
  deflibs      (219K)  }-  for the files in your Blitz drawer on your
  Ted          (57K)  /    Hard Disk.

                           The large defaultdbug file is the new Blitz
                           debugger and is for WB2.0+ Amigas only.

                           The large deflibs file contains all the new and 
                           updated libraries on the Blitzlibs disk. 

                           The Ted file is the new Blitz editor V2.1 and
                           is for WB2.0+ Amigas only.

  ted.library  (1K)   }-   This file is for Ted v2.1 and must go in
                           your Workbench Libs drawer.


For those of you still having problems getting Blitz to run from Hard
Disk...

     1. Make a new drawer (directory) on your hard disk using the Window 
        menu at the top of Workbench (a good name for it would be Blitz)
        and then open the drawer by double-clicking on it's icon.

        
     2. Insert the Blitz program disk and double-click on its disk icon.
        You can now see some of the Blitz program icons. Select Show/All
        files from the Workbench Window menu and a lot more will appear.


     3. Copy the followng files into your new hard disk drawer by
        dragging the files' icons into it. 

                           acidlibs
                           Blitz2
                           defaultdbug
                           deflibs
                           help
                           help.dat
                           Ted
                           Userlibs


      4. Now insert the Blitzlibs floppy disk and drag its disk icon into
         your new hard disk drawer. This will make another drawer called
         Blitzlibs and copy all the files on the floppy into it.
         You should now have all the necessary Blitz files on your hard
         disk.


      5. The (slightly) tricky bit.. Edit your Workbench startup sequence
         so that Blitz knows where to find its files. You can do this using
         Ted or any other text file editor. Workbench 2/3 users should add
         the following lines to their user-startup file found in their 
         Workbench:S drawer, it doesn't matter if you put them in the 
         startup-sequence file, but it's just a little tidier...


         Assign Blitz2: <Your Hard Drive>:<Your Blitz Drawer>

         Assign Blitzlibs: <Your Hard Drive>:<Your Blitz Drawer>/Blitzlibs


         Eg.1. If your Hard Drive Partition is called Work and you called
               your new drawer Blitz then you would add the lines...

         Assign Blitz2: Work:Blitz

         Assign Blitzlibs: Work:Blitz/Blitzlibs

         
         Eg.2. If you made your new Blitz drawer in an existing drawer such
               as Work:Programming then you would add the lines...

         Assign Blitz2: Work:Programming/Blitz

         Assign Blitzlibs: Work:Programming/Blitz/Blitzlibs


      6. Reset your Amiga so the assigns are active and then load Blitz...
