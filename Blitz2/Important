This disk has been configured to work with any 1Mb amiga from an A500 to
an A4000. Users with more memory, hard disk drives and WB2.0 or greater
can take advantage of the additional utilities on the extras disk.


The extras disk contains:

* BigDeflibs.lha  - all the amigalibs and third party libraries' object
                    code compiled into one file.

* Blitzlibs.lha   - all the object code for amigalibs and the third party
                    libraries and the resident files and utilities.

* LibsDev.lha     - an archive for advanced users wanting to create their
                    own libraries. It contains documentation, example
                    library source code and test examples for the third
                    party libraries.

* NewDebugger.lha - an advanced debugging utility that allows you to
                    view copper lists, memory, etc.

* NewTeditor.lha  - an Amiga style-guide compliant editor that requires
                    WB2.0 or greater.


NB: Please refer to the Blitz manual for the instructions on how to
    install the additional utilities and extras.
