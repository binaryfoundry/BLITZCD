                               THE STORY
                              -----------
     Whilst out on patrol our dashing hero DUCK DODGERS(tm) blah blah
   seemingly abandoned pleasure island blah blah blah  to check it out blah
   blah blah under attack from nasty alien thingies(tm).Blah blah blah he
   must kill them ALL.

      To kill the alien thingies(tm) he must use his dynimo powered stun gun
   (It saves on the batteries)
     Once the alien thingies(tm) are stunned they must
   be disposed of in the neutralizer pots, with a swift kick up the ass!

                            THE CONTROLS
                           --------------
     Use your joystick to move DUCK around screen. Remember that you must be
   moving  for DUCK's stun gun to work! To propel the alien thingies(tm)
   in to the neutralizer pots you have to stand next to the stunned alien
   and then push up on your joystick and fire.
