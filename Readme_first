The Blitz Support Suite

1996 Red When Excited Ltd

Thank  You  for  buying the Blitz Support Suite.  We hope you'll  find  this
prcduct to be a usefu and productive add-on for Blitz Basic 2.

Installation:

The installation process for the Blitz Support Suite uses the standard 
Amiga Installer program, which is provided for your convenience. 

To begin the Installation process:

1. Boot your marchine as normal (if you don't have a hard-drive, you should 
boot from your Workbench disk).

2. Double-click the 'BSS1' disk Icon when it appears on the Workbench screen

3. Inside the 'BSS1' window', double click the 'Install' icon and follow
on-screen, prompts.

To install the Blitz Support Suite you will need Blitz Basic 2 v1.9 or later
(Which is on this CD) - you will be asked which version of Blitz 2 you have 
at the start of the Installation process, You will also be given an 
opportunity to selectively install Blltz Support Suite program modules.

N.B. If your Amiga has 2Mb of RAM or less, you may have to quit any 
applications to install the Blitz Support Suite.

System Requirements:

To use the Blitz Support Suite fully you must have a hard-drive with 
approximately 5Mb of free space.

Certain programs in the Blitz Support Suite (e.g., REDMapEditor, REDShapeZ 
and SuperTED) can be run from floppy disk, though their performance may be 
limited. REDDebugger and REDBlitzLibs cannot be run from floppy disk due to 
space constraints. You will also need a minimum of 2Mb of RAM to use the 
Blitz Support Suite. As is the case with many development tools, the more 
RAM you nave, the better. If you have less than 2Mb of RAM, you should not 
install REDBlitzLibs or REDDebugger.
