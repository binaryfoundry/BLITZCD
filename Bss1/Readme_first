@NODE INTRODUCTION "Welcome..."

                               @{u}@{b}Introduction@{uu}@{ub}

Thank you for buying the Blitz Support Suite. We are confident that you'll find
this to be the most useful piece of development software for your Blitz Basic
creations.

@{u}Background@{uu}

During the development of our first commercial game - "BlitzBombers", we wrote
various utilities to assist us. When development of BlitzBombers was complete,
we looked at the Blitz scene and realised the need for a collection of high
quality development tools for Blitz programmers. We then set about adding a
large number of features to the utilities.

Before BlitzBombers was complete, we were contracted by Acid Software to work
on the Blitz text-editor 'TED'. We had to remove all OS Illegal functions from
TED as well as adding new features such as OS 2 file requesters. We delivered
the finished TED to Acid in September 1995, but work hasn't stopped. We have
spent the past few months adding some very powerful features to bring TED
up-to-date with the current batch of programmer's text-editor, whilst still
providing a close link with Blitz. Thus SuperTED was born.

The Blitz Support Suite is a collection of some the finest development tools
for the Amiga (not just specific to Blitz) and we hope your life as a developer
will be made much easier thanks to the supplied tools.

@ENDNODE INTRODUCTION


@NODE REQUIREMENTS "What do I need?"

                               @{u}@{b}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

The Blitz Support Suite will work on any Amiga running Kickstart v2.04 or higher.
A Hard Drive (with at least 3Mb free) is required for REDHelp, REDDebugger and
REDBlitzLibs.

Whilst some components of the Blitz Support Suite will work on any Amiga with
at least 1Mb of RAM, we recommend at least 2Mb.

Floppy drive only Amiga owners can still use REDShapeZ, REDMapEditor and SuperTED.

@NODE TROUBLESHOOTING "Troubleshooting..."

                              @{b}@{u}Troubleshooting@{ub}@{uu}

If you are experiencing problems with any part of Blitz Support Suite, the
following tips might prove helpful :


                                  @{u}General@{uu}

Q) 1 or more of the applications does not have an AREXX port, even though
   it is supposed to.

A) You must have RexxMast (located in the SYS:System folder) running before
   using any of the Blitz Support Suite tools.


Q) I can't get the online help to appear under REDMapEditor and REDDebugger.

A) Either :

	1) The relevant documentation was not installed
		- you should re-install the documentation via the
		  Blitz Support Suite installation program

	2) RexxMast is not running
		- Drag the file RexxMast (located in the System folder on your
		  Workbench partition) into the WBStartup folder. You will then
		  need to reboot your Amiga after saving any important data.


                                 @{u}SuperTED@{uu}

Q) SuperTED crashes whenever I run Blitz 2

A) Older versions of MCX and MCP have problems co-existing with SuperTED.
   You should either remove MCX/MCP from your WBStartup folder or upgrade
   to a newer version (the latest versions should be available from your
   local PD supplier or from the Aminet FTP sites)
