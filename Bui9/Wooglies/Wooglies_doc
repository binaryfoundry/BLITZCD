                            WOOGLIES INSTRUCTIONS
                           -----------------------

    The good news:- The  Wooglies  would  be  indestructible,  but for one
    weakness. They have to stay on the move at all times.  Lucky you!

    The bad news :- They are hungry, and after you. Shame!

    Your objective is to trap the  Wooglies and stop them from moving. You
    do so by pushing the   blocks.   There   is  only enough oxygen in the
    room to last for two minutes. If you do not trap them in the allocated
    time you will die. You may push as many blocks as you wish.

    Once you have trapped them,  they   will   die  and you advance to the
    next level. After every  three  levels  an  extra Wooglie will appear.
    There are 40 levels.

    Use the joystick to move   and   push   the   blocks.  You can throw a
    block behind you by  pressing  the  fire  button  and move towards the
    block you wish to fling.

    After every three levels the program  will supply you with a code. Use
    these codes to move to a higher level.

        From the intro screen you can press:-

                    Fire Button to enter the game.
                         C      to enter a level code.
                         S      to stop the music.
                        Esc     to leave the game and save Hi-Scores.

        During the game you may press:-

                         P      to pause the game. Press P re-start.
                         S      to toggle Music/Fx Sounds.
                        Esc     to return to intro screen.
