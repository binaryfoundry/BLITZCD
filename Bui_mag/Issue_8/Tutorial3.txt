COVERDISK GUI

(C) BUI

BY KEVIN WINSPEAR



Well, what have I got for you this month?  Well a few of you wanted to know have I got the coverdisk GUI program to not only change the mouse pointer but how to only change the pointer only when it's over a gadget.



Some of you might think this is very basic, but we have to provide for the beginners as well as all you brain boxes out there.



So I wrote this little program for the people who what to know such things.



WBStartup         ;Start from Workbench

NoCli                      ;Close Blitz CLI

CloseEd                    ;Close Blitz Editor

FindScreen 0         ;Find Workbench Screen



;Open Window

Window 0,50,50,200,100,$100e,"Pointer Test..",0,1



;Descode our shapes for the pointer.

DecodeShapes 0,?shapes



;Draw a box

WBox 20,40,180,60,3



;The variable p=0 if the pointer is in the box, else p=1

p=0



.Loop                      ;Start of our Loop

Repeat

Vwait                      ;Make sure things run smooth

  ev.l=Event         ;ev=Wait for an event but don't hold up the program



;While the pointer is within the MouseX and MouseY area

;change the mouse pointer to shape 1.

While WMouseX=>20  AND  WMouseX<=180  AND  WMouseY=>40  AND WMouseY<=60 

;Keep Mouse has Hand until out of box

VWait

If p=0           ;p=0 so change the pointer to 1 and p=1

WPointer 1:p=1

EndIf

Wend



;Now p=1 and we are not within the area so change the pointer

;back to 0

If p=1

WPointer 0:p=0

EndIf



;Repeat until one clicks on the close gadget.

Until ev=$200

End



;We Store everything at the end of the source code..

;Include our Pointer Shapes.

._Storage

  IncBin "Pointer.shape"
