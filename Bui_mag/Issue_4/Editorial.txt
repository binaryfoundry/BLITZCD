EDITORIAL

(C) BUI

By MATTHEW TILLETT



Well this has been an accomplishment, finally I have produced a long

awaited magazine dedicated to you, the users of Blitz basic. This issue

has been hard work, it can only get easier (I kid myself). With your help

each issue will get better. This month, we don't really have a lot in store

for you, the coverdisk has some useful programs on and some sample

code sent in by some reader's, and the magazine has some tutorials and

other useful bit's, but it really lacks some input from the readers. We are

really desperate for any material from you, write a letter, write an advert,

write a tutorial, send some code, send a program, just do something to

really fill the next issue. I would like to take this opportunity to thank

David Worswick for sending in lots of sample code and two smashing

games, Kevin Winspear for his programs and constant support and ideas,

Lee Packham for his programs, libraries and tutorial, and you for reading

this magazine. With a bit of hard work, we will make this mag the next

best thing to Blitz basic.



If you want to send us an article, some source code, a letter or

anything to go on the cover disk, please try to get it to us before the

first day of the month as this is our deadline date. If it arrives after

this day, your submission will be considered for the next months

issue.

Send your submissions to:- Blitz, Matthew Tillett, 27 Hillside

Avenue, Worlingham, Beccles, Suffolk, NR34 7AJ, England.
